abstract = {Peculiar velocities distort the correlation function of galaxies in redshift space. In the linear regime, the distortion has a characteristic quadrupole plus hexadecapole form. The amplitude of the distortion depends on the cosmological density parameter Q. Practical formulae are derived here which can be applied to redshift galaxy catalogs to measure Q in the linear regime. The formulae also yield the real underlying correlation function in the linear regime, corrected for peculiar velocities.},

abstract = {We have constructed a large format mosaic CCD camera for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The camera consists of two arrays, a photometric array which uses 30 2048 x 2048 SITe/Tektronix CCDs (24 micron pixels) with an effective imaging area of 720 square cm, and an astrometric array which uses 24 400 x 2048 CCDs with the same pixel size, which will allow us to tie bright astrometric standard stars to the objects imaged in the photometric camera. The instrument will be used to carry out photometry essentially simultaneously in five color bands spanning the range accessible to silicon detectors on the ground in the time-delay- and-integrate (TDI) scanning mode. The photometric detectors are arrayed in the focal plane in six columns of five chips each such that two scans cover a filled stripe 2.5 degrees wide.

abstract = {We present the large-scale correlation function measured from a spectroscopic sample of 46,748 luminous red galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The survey region covers 0.72 h{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}} Gpc{\^{}}3 over 3816 square degrees and 0.16{\textless}z{\textless}0.47, making it the best sample yet for the study of large-scale structure. We find a well-detected peak in the correlation function at 100h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc separation that is an excellent match to the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This detection demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between z=1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4{\%} fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to z=0.35 to 5{\%} accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation function, we measure the matter density Omega{\_}mh{\^{}}2 to 8{\%} and find agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB acoustic scale, we find Omega{\_}m = 0.273 +- 0.025 + 0.123 (1+w{\_}0) + 0.137 Omega{\_}K. Including the CMB acoustic scale, we find that the spatial curvature is Omega{\_}K=-0.010+-0.009 if the dark energy is a cosmological constant. More generally, our results provide a measurement of cosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy, based on a geometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave background anisotropies. The standard cosmological model convincingly passes these new and robust tests of its fundamental properties.},

abstract = {We describe the goals, design, implementation, and initial progress of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), a seven year sky survey which began in May 2005, using the UKIRT Wide Field Camera. It is a portfolio of five survey components covering various combinations of the filter set ZYJHK and H{\_}2. The Large Area Survey, the Galactic Clusters Survey, and the Galactic Plane Survey cover approximately 7000 square degrees to a depth of K{\~{}}18; the Deep Extragalactic Survey covers 35 square degrees to K{\~{}}21, and the Ultra Deep Survey covers 0.77 square degrees to K{\~{}}23. Summed together UKIDSS is 12 times larger in effective volume than the 2MASS survey. The prime aim of UKIDSS is to provide a long term astronomical legacy database; the design is however driven by a series of specific goals -- for example to find the nearest and faintest sub-stellar objects; to discover Population II brown dwarfs, if they exist; to determine the substellar mass function; to break the z=7 quasar barrier; to determine the epoch of re-ionisation; to measure the growth of structure from z=3 to the present day; to determine the epoch of spheroid formation; and to map the Milky Way through the dust, to several kpc. The survey data are being uniformly processed, and released in stages through the WFCAM Science Archive (WSA : http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). Before the formal survey began, UKIRT and the UKIDSS consortium collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of small science verification (SV) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera. We show some results from these SV projects in order to demonstrate the likely power of the eventual complete survey. Finally, using the data from the First Data Release we assess how well UKIDSS is meeting its design targets so far.},

abstract = {We explore the requirements for a Lyman-alpha forest (LyaF) survey designed to measure the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter at 2{\~{}}{\textless}z{\~{}}{\textless}4 using the standard ruler provided by baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO). The goal would be to obtain a high enough density of sources to probe the three-dimensional density field on the scale of the BAO feature. A percent-level measurement in this redshift range can almost double the Dark Energy Task Force Figure of Merit, relative to the case with only a similar precision measurement at z{\~{}}1, if the Universe is not assumed to be flat. This improvement is greater than the one obtained by doubling the size of the z{\~{}}1 survey, with Planck and a weak SDSS-like z=0.3 BAO measurement assumed in each case. Galaxy BAO surveys at z{\~{}}1 may be able to make an effective LyaF measurement simultaneously at minimal added cost, because the required number density of quasars is relatively small. We discuss the constraining power as a function of area, magnitude limit (density of quasars), resolution, and signal-to-noise of the spectra. For example, a survey covering 2000 sq. deg. and achieving S/N=1.8 per Ang. at g=23 ({\~{}}40 quasars per sq. deg.) with an R{\~{}}{\textgreater}250 spectrograph is sufficient to measure both the radial and transverse oscillation scales to 1.4{\%} from the LyaF (or better, if fainter magnitudes and possibly Lyman-break galaxies can be used). At fixed integration time and in the sky-noise-dominated limit, a wider, noisier survey is generally more efficient; the only fundamental upper limit on noise being the need to identify a quasar and find a redshift. Because the LyaF is much closer to linear and generally better understood than galaxies, systematic errors are even less likely to be a problem.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPublished in: Phys.Rev.D76:063009,2007},

Some more details, particularly analytic solutions for test-particle motion in open and closed models, are given by Whiting (2004). Some relevant further discussion is given by Barnes et al. (2006). 1 The meaning of an expanding universe The idea of an expanding universe can easily lead to confusion, and this note tries to counter some of the more tenacious misconceptions. The worst of these is the 'expanding space' fallacy. The RW metric written in comoving coordinates emphasizes that one can think of any given fundamental observer as fixed in a coordinate system where separations increase in proportion to R(t). A common interpretation of this algebra is to say that the galaxies separate " because the space between them expands " , or some such phrase. This seems a natural interpretation, but we need to worry about what the coordinates mean, as may be seen via two examples: the empty universe and de Sitter space. In the former case, Minkowski spacetime is rewritten as an expanding open RW metric with R(t) ∝ t. In the latter case, we can compare the usual metric for de Sitter space c 2 d$\tau$ 2 = c 2 dt 2 − R 2 (t) dr 2 + r 2 d$\psi$ 2 ; R(t) ∝ e},

abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11663 deg{\^{}}2 of imaging data, with most of the roughly 2000 deg{\^{}}2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry over 250 deg{\^{}}2 along the Celestial Equator in the Southern Galactic Cap. A coaddition of these data goes roughly two magnitudes fainter than the main survey. The spectroscopy is now complete over a contiguous area of 7500 deg{\^{}}2 in the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog (UCAC-2), reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milli-arcseconds per coordinate. A systematic error in bright galaxy photometr is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat-fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.

We build models of the distributions of stars and quasars in flux space down to the flux limit by applying the extreme-deconvolution method to estimate the underlying density. We convolve this density with the flux uncertainties when evaluating the probability that an object is a quasar. This approach results in a targeting algorithm that is more principled, more efficient, and faster than other similar methods. We apply the algorithm to derive low-redshift (z {\textless} 2.2), medium-redshift (2.2 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 3.5), and high-redshift (z {\textgreater} 3.5) quasar probabilities for all 160,904,060 point sources with dereddened i-band magnitude between 17.75 and 22.45 mag in the 14,555 deg{\^{}}2 of imaging from SDSS Data Release 8. The catalog can be used to define a uniformly selected and efficient low- or medium-redshift quasar survey, such as that needed for the SDSS-III's Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey project. We show that the XDQSO technique performs as well as the current best photometric quasar-selection technique at low redshift, and outperforms all other flux-based methods for selecting the medium-redshift quasars of our primary interest. We make code to reproduce the XDQSO quasar target selection publicly available.},

WISE is achieving 5 sigma point source sensitivities better than 0.08, 0.11, 1 and 6 mJy in unconfused regions on the ecliptic in bands centered at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 microns. Sensitivity improves toward the ecliptic poles due to denser coverage and lower zodiacal background. The angular resolution is 6.1, 6.4, 6.5 and 12.0 arc-seconds at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 microns, and the astrometric precision for high SNR sources is better than 0.15 arc-seconds.},

abstract = {We present an improved prescription for matter power spectrum in redshift space taking a proper account of both the non-linear gravitational clustering and redshift distortion, which are of particular importance for accurately modeling baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). Contrary to the models of redshift distortion phenomenologically introduced but frequently used in the literature, the new model includes the corrections arising from the non-linear coupling between the density and velocity fields associated with two competitive effects of redshift distortion, i.e., Kaiser and Finger-of-God effects. Based on the improved treatment of perturbation theory for gravitational clustering, we compare our model predictions with monopole and quadrupole power spectra of N-body simulations, and an excellent agreement is achieved over the scales of BAOs. Potential impacts on constraining dark energy and modified gravity from the redshift-space power spectrum are also investigated based on the Fisher-matrix formalism. We find that the existing phenomenological models of redshift distortion produce a systematic error on measurements of the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter by 1{\~{}}2{\%}, and the growth rate parameter by {\~{}}5{\%}, which would become non-negligible for future galaxy surveys. Correctly modeling redshift distortion is thus essential, and the new prescription of redshift-space power spectrum including the non-linear corrections can be used as an accurate theoretical template for anisotropic BAOs.},

abstract = {The imprint of Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) on the matter power spectrum can be constrained using the neutral hydrogen density in the intergalactic medium as a tracer of the matter density. One of the goals of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) is to derive the Hubble expansion rate and the angular scale from the BAO signal in the IGM. To this aim, the Lyman-alpha forest of 10{\^{}}5 quasars will be observed in the redshift range 2.2{\textless}z{\textless}3.5 and over 10,000 deg{\^{}}2. We simulated the BOSS QSO survey to estimate the statistical accuracy on the BAO scale determination provided by such a large scale survey. In particular, we discuss the effect of the poorly constrained estimate of the unabsorbed intrinsic quasar spectrum. The volume of current N-body simulations being too small for such studies, we resorted to Gaussian random field (GRF) simulations. We validated the use of GRFs by comparing the output of GRF simulations with that of the Horizon N-body simulation with the same initial conditions. Realistic mock samples of QSO Lyman-$\backslash$alpha forest were generated; their power spectrum was computed and fitted to obtain the BAO scale. The rms of the results for 100 different simulations provides an estimate of the statistical error expected from the BOSS survey. We confirm the results from Fisher matrix estimate. In the absence of error on the unabsorbed quasar spectrum, the BOSS quasar survey should measure the BAO scale with an error of the order of 2.3{\%}, or the transverse and radial BAO scales separately with errors of the order of 6.8{\%} and 3.9{\%}, respectively. The significance of the BAO detection is assessed by an average $\backslash$Delta$\backslash$chi{\^{}}2=17 but for individual realizations $\backslash$Delta$\backslash$chi{\^{}}2 ranges from 2 t o 35. The error on the unabsorbed quasar spectrum increases the error on the BAO scale by 10 to 20{\%} and results in a sub percent bias.},

abstract = {Using a sample of approximately 14,000 z{\textgreater}2.1 quasars observed in the first year of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), we measure the three-dimensional correlation function of absorption in the Lyman-alpha forest. The angle-averaged correlation function of transmitted flux (F = exp(-tau)) is securely detected out to comoving separations of 60 Mpc/h, the first detection of flux correlations across widely separated sightlines. A quadrupole distortion of the redshift-space correlation function by peculiar velocities, the signature of the gravitational instability origin of structure in the Lyman-alpha forest, is also detected at high significance. We obtain a good fit to the data assuming linear theory redshift-space distortion and linear bias of the transmitted flux, relative to the matter fluctuations of a standard LCDM cosmological model (inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological constant). At 95{\%} confidence, we find a linear bias parameter 0.16{\textless}b{\textless}0.24 and redshift-distortion parameter 0.44{\textless}beta{\textless}1.20, at central redshift z=2.25, with a well constrained combination b(1+$\backslash$beta)=0.336 +/- 0.012. The errors on beta are asymmetric, with beta=0 excluded at over 5 sigma confidence level. The value of beta is somewhat low compared to theoretical predictions, and our tests on synthetic data suggest that it is depressed (relative to expectations for the Lyman-alpha forest alone) by the presence of high column density systems and metal line absorption. These results set the stage for cosmological parameter determinations from three-dimensional structure in the Lyman-alpha forest, including anticipated constraints on dark energy from baryon acoustic oscillations.},

Massive spectroscopic surveys of high-redshift quasars yield large numbers of correlated Ly$\alpha$ absorption spectra that can be used to measure large-scale structure. Simu-lations of these surveys are required to accurately interpret the measurements of correlations and correct for systematic errors. An efficient method to generate mock realizations of Ly$\alpha$ forest surveys is presented which generates a field over the lines of sight to the survey sources only, instead of having to generate it over the entire three-dimensional volume of the survey. The method can be calibrated to reproduce the power spectrum and one-point distribution function of the transmitted flux fraction, as well as the redshift evolution of these quantities, and is easily used for modeling any survey systematic effects. We present an example of how these mock surveys are applied to predict the measurement errors in a survey with similar parameters as the BOSS quasar survey in SDSS-III.},

abstract = {On large scales a nonlinear transformation of matter density field can be viewed as a biased tracer of the density field itself. A nonlinear transformation also modifies the redshift space distortions in the same limit, giving rise to a velocity bias. In models with primordial nongaussianity a nonlinear transformation generates a scale dependent bias on large scales. We derive analytic expressions for these for a general nonlinear transformation. These biases can be expressed entirely in terms of the one point distribution function (PDF) of the final field and the parameters of the transformation. Our analysis allows one to devise nonlinear transformations with nearly arbitrary bias properties, which can be used to increase the signal in the large scale clustering limit. We apply the results to the ionizing equilibrium model of Lyman-alpha forest, in which Lyman-alpha flux F is related to the density perturbation delta via a nonlinear transformation. Velocity bias can be expressed as an average over the Lyman-alpha flux PDF. At z=2.4 we predict the velocity bias of -0.1, compared to the observed value of -0.13 +/- 0.03. Bias and primordial nongaussianity bias depend on the parameters of the transformation. Measurements of bias can thus be used to constrain these parameters, and for reasonable values of the ionizing background intensity we can match the predictions to observations. Matching to the observed values we predict the ratio of primordial nongaussianity bias to bias to have the opposite sign and lower magnitude than the corresponding values for the highly biased galaxies, but this depends on the model parameters and can also vanish or change the sign.},

abstract = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) is designed to measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter over a larger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveys of large scale structure. BOSS uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint as i=19.9 over 10,000 square degrees to measure BAO to redshifts z{\textless}0.7. Observations of neutral hydrogen in the Lyman alpha forest in more than 150,000 quasar spectra (g{\textless}22) will constrain BAO over the redshift range 2.15{\textless}z{\textless}3.5. Early results from BOSS include the first detection of the large-scale three-dimensional clustering of the Lyman alpha forest and a strong detection from the Data Release 9 data set of the BAO in the clustering of massive galaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. We project that BOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance D{\_}A to an accuracy of 1.0{\%} at redshifts z=0.3 and z=0.57 and measurements of H(z) to 1.8{\%} and 1.7{\%} at the same redshifts.

abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of “dark energy” with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious efforts to understand its origin, with experiments that aim to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and the abundance of galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit “Stage IV” dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock–Paczynski effect, and direct measurements of the Hubble constant H0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from General Relativity, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background data. We also show the level of precision required for clusters or other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets that support a wide range of scientific investigations, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales.},

The study uses 48,640 quasars in the redshift range {\$}2.1\backslashle z \backslashle 3.5{\$} from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the third generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III). At a mean redshift {\$}z=2.3{\$}, we measure the monopole and quadrupole components of the correlation function for separations in the range {\$}20\backslashhMpc{\textless}r{\textless}200\backslashhMpc{\$}. A peak in the correlation function is seen at a separation equal to {\$}(1.01\backslashpm0.03){\$} times the distance expected for the BAO peak within a concordance {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM cosmology. This first detection of the BAO peak at high redshift, when the universe was strongly matter dominated, results in constraints on the angular diameter distance {\$}\backslashda{\$} and the expansion rate {\$}H{\$} at {\$}z=2.3{\$} that, by themselves, require the existence of dark energy. Combined with constraints derived from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations, this result implies {\$}H(z=2.3)=(224\backslashpm8){\{}\backslashrm km s{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}Mpc{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\}}{\$}, indicating that the time derivative of the cosmological scale parameter {\$}\backslashdot{\{}a{\}}=H(z=2.3)/(1+z){\$} is significantly greater than that measured with BAO at {\$}z\backslashsim0.5{\$}. This demonstrates that the expansion was decelerating in the range {\$}0.7{\textless}z{\textless}2.3{\$}, as expected from the matter domination during this epoch. Combined with measurements of {\$}H{\_}0{\$}, one sees the pattern of deceleration followed by acceleration characteristic of a dark-energy dominated universe.},

abstract = {We examine recent measurements of the z{\~{}}2.5 intergalactic medium (IGM) which constrain the HI frequency distribution f(N) and the mean free path MFP to ionizing radiation. We argue that line-blending and the clustering of strong absorption-line systems have led previous authors to systematically overestimate the effective Lyman limit opacity, yielding too small of a MFP for the IGM. We further show that recently published measurements of f(N) at log NHI {\~{}} 16 lie in strong disagreement, implying underestimated uncertainty from sample variance and/or systematics like line-saturation. Allowing for a larger uncertainty in the f(N) measurements, we provide a new cubic Hermite spline model for f(N) which reasonably satisfies all of the observational constraints under the assumption of randomly distributed absorption systems. We caution, however, that this formalism is invalid in light of absorber clustering and use a toy model to estimate the effects. Future work must properly account for the non-Poissonian nature of the IGM.},

abstract = {We derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energy models from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data. We take advantage of high-precision BAO measurements from galaxy clustering and the Ly-alpha forest (LyaF) in the BOSS survey of SDSS-III. BAO data alone yield a high confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the CMB angular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. Combining BAO and SN data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7{\%} measurement of {\$}H{\_}0=67.3 \backslashpm1.1{\$} km/s/Mpc. This measurement assumes standard pre-recombination physics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature, so agreement with CMB-based estimates that assume a flat LCDM cosmology is an important corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. For open LCDM, our BAO+SN+CMB combination yields {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}m=0.301 \backslashpm 0.008{\$} and curvature {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}k=-0.003 \backslashpm 0.003{\$}. When we allow more general forms of evolving dark energy, the BAO+SN+CMB parameter constraints remain consistent with flat LCDM. While the overall {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\$} of model fits is satisfactory, the LyaF BAO measurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions. Models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at high redshifts remain consistent with our constraints. Expansion history alone yields an upper limit of 0.56 eV on the summed mass of neutrino species, improving to 0.26 eV if we include Planck CMB lensing. Standard dark energy models constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that is high compared to most, but not all, observational estimates. (Abridged)},

This sample contains three times the number of quasars used in previous studies. The measured position of the BAO peak determines the angular distance, {\$}D{\_}A(z=2.34){\$} and expansion rate, {\$}H(z=2.34){\$}, both on a scale set by the sound horizon at the drag epoch, {\$}r{\_}d{\$}. We find {\$}D{\_}A/r{\_}d=11.28\backslashpm0.65(1\backslashsigma){\^{}}{\{}+2.8{\}}{\_}{\{}-1.2{\}}(2\backslashsigma){\$} and {\$}D{\_}H/r{\_}d=9.18\backslashpm0.28(1\backslashsigma)\backslashpm0.6(2\backslashsigma){\$} where {\$}D{\_}H=c/H{\$}. The optimal combination, {\$}\backslashsim D{\_}H{\^{}}{\{}0.7{\}}D{\_}A{\^{}}{\{}0.3{\}}/r{\_}d{\$} is determined with a precision of {\$}\backslashsim2\backslash{\%}{\$}.

Tests with mock catalogs and variations of our analysis procedure have revealed no systematic uncertainties comparable to our statistical errors. Our results agree with the previously reported BAO measurement at the same redshift using the quasar-Ly{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} forest cross-correlation. The auto-correlation and cross-correlation approaches are complementary because of the quite different impact of redshift-space distortion on the two measurements. The combined constraints from the two correlation functions imply values of {\$}D{\_}A/r{\_}d{\$} and {\$}D{\_}H/r{\_}d{\$} that are, respectively, 7{\%} low and 7{\%} high compared to the predictions of a flat {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM cosmological model with the best-fit Planck parameters.

Starting with the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation applied to the smoothed total density field in real-space, and progressing through redshift-space with no thermal broadening, redshift-space with thermal broadening and hydrodynamicaly simulated baryon fields, we investigate how approximations found in the literature fare. We find that Seljak's 2012 analytical formulae for these bias parameters work surprisingly well in the limit of no thermal broadening and linear redshift-space distortions. We also show that his {\$}b{\_}\backslasheta{\$} formula is exact in the limit of no thermal broadening. Since introduction of thermal broadening significantly affects its value, we speculate that a combination of large-scale measurements of {\$}b{\_}\backslasheta{\$} and the small scale flux PDF might be a sensitive probe of the thermal state of the IGM. We find that large-scale biases derived from the smoothed total matter field are within 10-20$\backslash${\%} to those based on hydrodynamical quantities, in line with other measurements in the literature.},

All the data from SDSS-III are now made public. In particular, this paper describes Data Release 11 (DR11) including all data acquired through 2013 July, and Data Release 12 (DR12) adding data acquired through 2014 July (including all data included in previous data releases), marking the end of SDSS-III observing. Relative to our previous public release (DR10), DR12 adds one million new spectra of galaxies and quasars from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) over an additional 3000 sq. deg of sky, more than triples the number of H-band spectra of stars as part of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and includes repeated accurate radial velocity measurements of 5500 stars from the Multi-Object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS). The APOGEE outputs now include measured abundances of 15 different elements for each star. In total, SDSS-III added 2350 sq. deg of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of the Sloan Exploration of Galactic Understanding and Evolution 2 (SEGUE-2) survey; 2,497,484 BOSS spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216 stars over 9376 sq. deg; 618,080 APOGEE spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040 MARVELS spectra of 5,513 stars.

abstract = {The Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will conduct novel cosmological observations using the BOSS spectrograph at Apache Point Observatory. Observations will be simultaneous with the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) designed for variability studies and the Spectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) program designed for studies of X-ray sources. eBOSS will use four different tracers to measure the distance-redshift relation with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). Using more than 250,000 new, spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies at a median redshift z=0.72, we project that eBOSS will yield measurements of {\$}d{\_}A(z){\$} to an accuracy of 1.2{\%} and measurements of H(z) to 2.1{\%} when combined with the z{\textgreater}0.6 sample of BOSS galaxies. With {\~{}}195,000 new emission line galaxy redshifts, we expect BAO measurements of {\$}d{\_}A(z){\$} to an accuracy of 3.1{\%} and H(z) to 4.7{\%} at an effective redshift of z= 0.87. A sample of more than 500,000 spectroscopically-confirmed quasars will provide the first BAO distance measurements over the redshift range 0.9{\textless}z{\textless}2.2, with expected precision of 2.8{\%} and 4.2{\%} on {\$}d{\_}A(z){\$} and H(z), respectively. Finally, with 60,000 new quasars and re-observation of 60,000 quasars known from BOSS, we will obtain new Lyman-alpha forest measurements at redshifts z{\textgreater}2.1; these new data will enhance the precision of {\$}d{\_}A(z){\$} and H(z) by a factor of 1.44 relative to BOSS. Furthermore, eBOSS will provide improved tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales through redshift-space distortion measurements, improved tests for non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field, and new constraints on the summed mass of all neutrino species. Here, we provide an overview of the cosmological goals, spectroscopic target sample, demonstration of spectral quality from early data, and projected cosmological constraints from eBOSS.},

abstract = {The BOSS quasar sample is used to study cosmic homogeneity with a 3D survey in the redshift range 2.2 {\textless}z {\textless}2.8. We measure the
count-in-sphere, N({\textless}r), i.e. the average number of objects around a given object, and its logarithmic derivative, the fractal correlation dimension, D2(r). For a homogeneous distribution N({\textless}r) propto r3 and D2(r) = 3. Due to the uncertainty on tracer density evolution, 3D surveys can only probe homogeneity up to a redshift dependence, i.e. they probe so-called ``spatial isotropy". Our data demonstrate spatial isotropy of the quasar distribution in the redshift range 2.2 {\textless}z {\textless}2.8 in a model-independent way,
independent of any FLRW fiducial cosmology, resulting in 3 ‑
langleD2rangle {\textless}1.7 × 10‑3 (2
$\sigma$) over the range 250 {\textless}r {\textless}1200 h‑1 Mpc
for the quasar distribution. If we assume that quasars do not have a bias much less than unity, this implies spatial isotropy of the matter distribution on large scales. Then, combining with the Copernican principle, we finally get homogeneity of the matter distribution on large scales. Alternatively, using a flat $\Lambda$CDM fiducial cosmology with CMB-derived parameters, and measuring the quasar bias relative to this $\Lambda$CDM model, our data provide a consistency check of the
model, in terms of how homogeneous the Universe is on different scales. D2(r) is found to be compatible with our $\Lambda$CDM model on the whole 10 {\textless}r {\textless}1200 h‑1 Mpc range. For the
matter distribution we obtain 3 ‑ langleD2rangle {\textless}5

abstract = {Correlations measured in 3D in the Lyman-alpha forest are contaminated by the presence of the damping wings of high column density (HCD) absorbing systems of neutral hydrogen (HI; having column densities {\$}N(\backslashmathrm{\{}HI{\}}) {\textgreater} 1.6 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}17{\}}\backslash,\backslashmathrm{\{}atoms{\}}\backslash,\backslashmathrm{\{}cm{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}), which extend significantly beyond the redshift-space location of the absorber. We measure this effect as a function of the column density of the HCD absorbers and redshift by measuring 3D flux power spectra in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the Illustris project. Survey pipelines exclude regions containing the largest damping wings. We find that, even after this procedure, there is a scale-dependent correction to the 3D Lyman-alpha forest flux power spectrum from residual contamination. We model this residual using a simple physical model of the HCD absorbers as linearly biased tracers of the matter density distribution, convolved with their Voigt profiles and integrated over the column density distribution function. We recommend the use of this model over existing models used in data analysis, which approximate the damping wings as top-hats and so miss shape information in the extended wings. The simple linear Voigt model is statistically consistent with our simulation results for a mock residual contamination up to small scales ({\$}k {\textless} 1\backslash,h\backslash,\backslashmathrm{\{}Mpc{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}), even though it cannot account for the effect of the highest column density absorbers (which are in any case preferentially removed from survey data) on the smallest scales (e.g., {\$}k {\textgreater} 0.4\backslash,h\backslash,\backslashmathrm{\{}Mpc{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} for small DLAs; {\$}N(\backslashmathrm{\{}HI{\}}) \backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}21{\}}\backslash,\backslashmathrm{\{}atoms{\}}\backslash,\backslashmathrm{\{}cm{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}). Our model is appropriate for an accurate analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillations feature and it is additionally essential for reconstructing the full shape of the 3D flux power spectrum, assuming that the highest column density absorbers are removed.},

abstract = {We describe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV), a project encompassing three major spectroscopic programs. The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2) is observing hundreds of thousands of Milky Way stars at high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio in the near-infrared. The Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey is obtaining spatially-resolved spectroscopy for thousands of nearby galaxies (median redshift of z = 0.03). The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is mapping the galaxy, quasar, and neutral gas distributions between redshifts z = 0.6 and 3.5 to constrain cosmology using baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and the shape of the power spectrum. Within eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: the SPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-ray AGN and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5-meter Sloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory; observations there began in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second near-infrared spectrograph at the 2.5-meter du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, with observations beginning in early 2017. Observations at both facilities are scheduled to continue through 2020. In keeping with previous SDSS policy, SDSS-IV provides regularly scheduled public data releases; the first one, Data Release 13, was made available in July 2016.},

abstract = {We present a measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the cross-correlation of quasars with the Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-forest flux-transmission at a mean redshift {\$}z=2.40{\$}. The measurement uses the complete SDSS-III data sample: 168,889 forests and 234,367 quasars from the SDSS Data Release DR12. In addition to the statistical improvement on our previous study using DR11, we have implemented numerous improvements at the analysis level allowing a more accurate measurement of this cross-correlation. We also developed the first simulations of the cross-correlation allowing us to test different aspects of our data analysis and to search for potential systematic errors in the determination of the BAO peak position. We measure the two ratios {\$}D{\_}{\{}H{\}}(z=2.40)/r{\_}{\{}d{\}} = 9.01 \backslashpm 0.36{\$} and {\$}D{\_}{\{}M{\}}(z=2.40)/r{\_}{\{}d{\}} = 35.7 \backslashpm 1.7{\$}, where the errors include marginalization over the non-linear velocity of quasars and the metal - quasar cross-correlation contribution, among other effects. These results are within {\$}1.8\backslashsigma{\$} of the prediction of the flat-{\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model describing the observed CMB anisotropies. We combine this study with the Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-forest auto-correlation function [2017A{\&}A...603A..12B], yielding {\$}D{\_}{\{}H{\}}(z=2.40)/r{\_}{\{}d{\}} = 8.94 \backslashpm 0.22{\$} and {\$}D{\_}{\{}M{\}}(z=2.40)/r{\_}{\{}d{\}} = 36.6 \backslashpm 1.2{\$}, within {\$}2.3\backslashsigma{\$} of the same flat-{\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model.},

Besides the statistical improvements on our previous studies using SDSS DR9 and DR11, we have implemented numerous improvements in the analysis procedure, allowing us to construct a physical model of the correlation function and to investigate potential systematic errors in the determination of the BAO peak position. The Hubble distance, {\$}\backslashDHub=c/H(z){\$}, relative to the sound horizon is {\$}\backslashDHub(z=2.33)/r{\_}d=9.07 \backslashpm 0.31{\$}. The best-determined combination of comoving angular-diameter distance, {\$}\backslashDM{\$}, and the Hubble distance is found to be {\$}\backslashDHub{\^{}}{\{}0.7{\}}\backslashDM{\^{}}{\{}0.3{\}}/r{\_}d=13.94\backslashpm0.35{\$}.

abstract = {We study here how the presence of non-zero matter density and a cosmological constant could affect the observation of gravitational waves in Pulsar Timing Arrays. Conventionally, the effect of matter and cosmological constant is included by considering the redshift in frequency due to the expansion. However, there is an additional effect due to the change of coordinate systems from the natural ones in the region where waves are produced to the ones used to measure the pulsar timing residuals. This change is unavoidable as the strong gravitational field in a black hole merger distorts clocks and rules. Harmonic waves produced in such a merger become anharmonic when detected by a cosmological observer. The effect is small but appears to be observable for the type of gravitational waves to which PTA are sensitive and for the favoured values of the cosmological parameters.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the cross-correlation of the triply-ionized carbon (CIV) forest with quasars using Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14. The study exploits a large sample of new quasars from the first two years of observations by the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). The CIV forest is a weaker tracer of large-scale structure than the Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} forest, but benefits from being accessible at redshifts {\$}z{\textless}2{\$} where the quasar number density from eBOSS is high. Our data sample consists of 287,651 CIV forest quasars in the redshift range {\$}1.4{\textless}z{\textless}3.5{\$} and 387,315 tracer quasars with {\$}1.2{\textless}z{\textless}3.5{\$}. We measure large-scale correlations from CIV absorption occuring in three distinct quasar rest-frame wavelength bands of the spectra referred to as the CIV forest, the SiIV forest and the Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} forest. From the combined fit to the quasar-CIV cross-correlations for the CIV forest and the SiIV forest, the CIV redshift-space distortion parameter is {\$}\backslashbeta{\_}{\{}\backslashrm CIV{\}}=0.27{\_}{\{}\backslash -0.14{\}}{\^{}}{\{}\backslash +0.16{\}}{\$} and its combination with the CIV linear transmission bias parameter is {\$}b{\_}{\{}\backslashrm CIV{\}}(1+\backslashbeta{\_}{\{}\backslashrm CIV{\}})=-0.0183{\_}{\{}\backslash -0.0014{\}}{\^{}}{\{}\backslash +0.0013{\}}{\$} ({\$}1\backslashsigma{\$} statistical error) at the mean redshift {\$}z=2.00{\$}. Splitting the sample at {\$}z=2.2{\$} to constrain the bias evolution with redshift yields the power-law exponent {\$}\backslashgamma=0.60\backslashpm0.63{\$}, indicating a significantly weaker redshift-evolution than for the Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} forest linear transmission bias. We demonstrate that CIV absorption has the potential to be used as a probe of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). While the current data set is insufficient for a detection of the BAO peak feature, the final quasar samples for redshifts {\$}1.4{\textless}z{\textless}2.2{\$} from eBOSS and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) are expected to provide measurements of the isotropic BAO scale to {\$}\backslashsim7\backslash{\%}{\$} and {\$}\backslashsim3\backslash{\%}{\$} precision, respectively, at {\$}z\backslashsimeq1.6{\$}.},

From the measured BAO peak position along and across the line of sight, we determine the Hubble distance {\$}D{\_}{\{}H{\}}{\$} and the comoving angular diameter distance {\$}D{\_}{\{}M{\}}{\$} relative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch {\$}r{\_}{\{}d{\}}{\$}: {\$}D{\_}{\{}H{\}}(z=2.35)/r{\_}{\{}d{\}}=9.20\backslashpm 0.36{\$} and {\$}D{\_}{\{}M{\}}(z=2.35)/r{\_}{\{}d{\}}=36.3\backslashpm 1.8{\$}. These results are consistent at {\$}1.5\backslashsigma{\$} with the prediction of the best-fit flat {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM cosmological model reported for the Planck (2016) analysis of CMB anisotropies. Combined with the Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} auto-correlation measurement presented in a companion paper (de Sainte Agathe et al. 2019) the BAO measurements at {\$}z=2.34{\$} are within {\$}1.7\backslashsigma{\$} of the predictions of this model.},

abstract = {Recent research show that the cosmological components of the Universe should influence on the propagation and observation of Gravitational Waves. Furthermore, it has been proposed a new way to measure the cosmological constant using Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA). However, these results have considered very particular cases (e.g. a Universe filled only by dark energy or by a mixing with dust). In this work we propose an extension of this model: We considered a Universe filled by different perfect fluids, with arbitrary equations of state, and studied the propagation of Gravitational Waves within the context of the LCDM model. From this framework we obtained a relationship, e.g. an analytical formula that differs by 1.5 $\backslash${\%} from numerical simulations, between the value of the Hubble constant and the observables of PTA experiments, which are expected to measure time residual from local pulsars due to the pass of Gravitational Waves by the IPTA project in the near future.},
