abstract = {The polarized thermal emission from Galactic dust is the main foreground present in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at frequencies above 100GHz. We exploit the Planck HFI polarization data from 100 to 353GHz to measure the dust angular power spectra {\$}C\backslash{\_}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}ell{\{}\backslashtextasciicircum{\}}{\{}EE,BB{\}}{\$} over the range {\$}40{\textless}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}ell{\textless}600{\$}. These will bring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determination of the level of contamination for CMB polarization experiments. We show that statistical properties of the emission can be characterized over large fractions of the sky using {\$}C\backslash{\_}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}ell{\$}. For the dust, they are well described by power laws in $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}ell{\$} with exponents $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}alpha{\{}\backslashtextasciicircum{\}}{\{}EE,BB{\}}=-2.42{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}pm0.02{\$}. The amplitudes of the polarization {\$}C\backslash{\_}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}ell{\$} vary with the average brightness in a way similar to the intensity ones. The dust polarization frequency dependence is consistent with modified blackbody emission with $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}beta{\_}d=1.59{\$} and {\$}T{\_}d=19.6{\$}K. We find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the Galactic {\$}B{\$}- and {\$}E{\$}-modes of 0.5. We show that even in the faintest dust-emitting regions there are no "clean" windows where primordial CMB {\$}B{\$}-mode polarization could be measured without subtraction of dust emission. Finally, we investigate the level of dust polarization in the BICEP2 experiment field. Extrapolation of the Planck 353GHz data to 150GHz gives a dust power $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}ell({\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}ell+1)C\backslash{\_}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}ell{\{}\backslashtextasciicircum{\}}{\{}BB{\}}/(2{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}pi){\$} of {\$}1.32{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}times10{\{}\backslashtextasciicircum{\}}{\{}-2\backslash{\}}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}mu{\$}K{\$}{\_}{\{}CMB\backslash{\}}{\{}\backslashtextasciicircum{\}}2{\$} over the {\$}40{\textless}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}ell{\textless}120{\$} range; the statistical uncertainty is $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}pm0.29{\$} and there is an additional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the same units. This is the same magnitude as reported by BICEP2 over this $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}ell{\$} range, which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal. The present uncertainties will be reduced through an ongoing, joint analysis of the Planck and BICEP2 data sets.},

abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

@article{bonvin_asymmetric_2014,
abstract = {We study the two-point cross-correlation function between two populations of galaxies: for instance, a bright population and a faint population. We show that this cross-correlation is asymmetric under the exchange of the line-of-sight coordinate of the galaxies, i.e. that the correlation is different if the bright galaxy is in front of, or behind, the faint galaxy. We give an intuitive, quasi-Newtonian derivation of all the effects that contribute to such an asymmetry in large-scale structure: gravitational redshift, Doppler shift, lensing, light-cone, evolution and Alcock-Paczynski effects; interestingly, the gravitational redshift term is exactly canceled by some of the others, assuming geodesic motion. Most of these effects are captured by previous calculations of general relativistic corrections to the observed galaxy density fluctuation; the asymmetry arises from terms that are suppressed by the ratio (H/k)—H is the Hubble constant and k is the wave number—which are more readily observable than the terms suppressed by (H/k)2. Some of the contributions to the asymmetry, however, arise from terms that are generally considered “Newtonian”—the lensing and evolution—and thus represent a contaminant in the search for general relativistic corrections. We propose methods to disentangle these different contributions. A simple method reduces the contamination to a level of ≲10{\%} for redshifts z≲1. We also clarify the relation to recent work on measuring gravitational redshifts by stacking clusters.},

abstract = {We measure the clustering of a sample of photometrically selected 
luminous red galaxies (LRGs) around a low-redshift (0.2 {\textless}z {\textless}0.6)
sample of quasars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data
Release 5. We make use of a new statistical estimator to obtain precise
measurements of the LRG autocorrelations and constrain halo occupation
distributions for them. These are used to generate mock catalogues which
aid in interpreting our quasar-LRG cross-correlation measurements. The
cross-correlation is well described by a power law with slope 1.8 +/-
0.1 and r0 = 6 +/- 0.5h-1Mpc, consistent with
observed galaxy correlation functions. We find no evidence for `excess'
clustering on 0.1Mpc scales and demonstrate that this is consistent with
the results of Serber et al. and Strand, Brunner and Myers, when one
accounts for several subtleties in the interpretation of their
measurements. Combining the quasar-LRG cross-correlation with the LRG
autocorrelations, we determine a large-scale quasar bias bQSO
= 1.09 +/- 0.15 at a median redshift of 0.43, with no observed redshift
or luminosity evolution. This corresponds to a mean halo mass 
{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 1012h-1Msolar, Eddington ratios from
0.01 to 1 and lifetimes less than 107yr. Using simple models
of halo occupation, these correspond to a number density of quasar hosts
greater than 10-3 h3Mpc-3 and stellar
masses less than 1011 h-1Msolar. The
small-scale clustering signal can be interpreted with the aid of our
mock LRG catalogues, and depends on the manner in which quasars inhabit
haloes. We find that our small-scale measurements are inconsistent with
quasar positions being randomly subsampled from halo centres above a
mass threshold, requiring a satellite fraction {\textgreater}25 per cent.},

abstract = {We construct dynamical models for a sample of 36 nearby galaxies with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry and ground-based kinematics. The models assume that each galaxy is axisymmetric, with a two-integral distribution function, arbitrary inclination angle, a position-independent stellar mass-to-light ratio Upsilon, and a central massive dark object (MDO) of arbitrary mass M{\_}•. They provide acceptable fits to 32 of the galaxies for some value of M{\_}• and Upsilon the four galaxies that cannot be fitted have kinematically decoupled cores. The mass-to-light ratios inferred for the 32 well-fitted galaxies are consistent with the fundamental-plane correlation Upsilon L{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}0.2, where L is galaxy luminosity. In all but six galaxies the models require at the 95{\%} confidence level an MDO of mass M{\_}• 0.006M{\_}bulge = 0.006UpsilonL. Five of the six galaxies consistent with M{\_}• = 0 are also consistent with this correlation. The other (NGC 7332) has a much stronger upper limit on M{\_}•. We predict the second-moment profiles that should be observed at HST resolution for the 32 galaxies that our models describe well. We consider various parameterizations for the probability distribution describing the correlation of the masses of these MDOs with other galaxy properties. One of the best models can be summarized thus: a fraction f = 0.97 of early-type galaxies have MDOs, whose masses are well described by a Gaussian distribution in log (M{\_}•/M{\_}bulge) of mean -2.28 and standard deviation 0.51. There is also marginal evidence that M{\_}• is distributed differently for “core” and “power law” galaxies, with core galaxies having a somewhat steeper dependence on M{\_}bulge.},

abstract = {Recent research show that the cosmological components of the Universe should influence on the propagation and observation of Gravitational Waves. Furthermore, it has been proposed a new way to measure the cosmological constant using Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA). However, these results have considered very particular cases (e.g. a Universe filled only by dark energy or by a mixing with dust). In this work we propose an extension of this model: We considered a Universe filled by different perfect fluids, with arbitrary equations of state, and studied the propagation of Gravitational Waves within the context of the LCDM model. From this framework we obtained a relationship, e.g. an analytical formula that differs by 1.5 $\backslash${\%} from numerical simulations, between the value of the Hubble constant and the observables of PTA experiments, which are expected to measure time residual from local pulsars due to the pass of Gravitational Waves by the IPTA project in the near future.},

indicate (at the 2.5$\sigma$ level) that X-ray AGNs reside in more
massive halos compared to more bolometrically luminous, optically

constraints on the duty cycle of the X-ray AGN, and we find that at z {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}
1.2 the average duration of the X-ray AGN phase is two orders of
magnitude longer than that of the quasar phase. Our inferred mean
occupation function of X-ray AGNs is similar to recent empirical
measurements with a group catalog and suggests that AGN halo occupancy
increases with increasing halo mass. We project the XMM-COSMOS 2PCF
measurements to forecast the required survey parameters needed in future
AGN clustering studies to enable higher precision HOD constraints and
determinations of key physical parameters like the satellite fraction
and duty cycle. We find that N 2/A {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 5 × 106
deg-2 (with N the number of AGNs in a survey area of A
deg2) is sufficient to constrain the HOD parameters at the
10{\%} level, which is easily achievable by upcoming and proposed X-ray
surveys.},

abstract = {Clowes et al. (2013) have recently reported the discovery of a Large Quasar Group (LQG), dubbed the Huge-LQG, at redshift z{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}1.3 in the DR7 quasar catalogue of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. On the basis of its characteristic size {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}500 Mpc and longest dimension {\textgreater}1 Gpc, it is claimed that this structure is incompatible with large-scale homogeneity and the cosmological principle. If true, this would represent a serious challenge to the standard cosmological model. However, the homogeneity scale is an average property which is not necessarily affected by the discovery of a single large structure. I clarify this point and provide the first fractal dimension analysis of the DR7 quasar catalogue to demonstrate that it is in fact homogeneous above scales of at most 130 Mpc/h, which is much less than the upper limit for {\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}Lambda CDM. In addition, I show that the algorithm used to identify the Huge-LQG regularly finds even larger clusters of points, extending over Gpc scales, in explicitly homogeneous simulations of a Poisson point process with the same density as the quasar catalogue. This provides a simple null test to be applied to any cluster thus found in a real catalogue, and suggests that the interpretation of LQGs as `structures' is misleading.},

The reionized universe serves as a mirror to reflect CMB photons, thereby permitting a view of ourselves and the local gravitational potential. By comparing with measurements of the CMB spectrum, a limit is placed on the possibility that we occupy a privileged location, residing at the center of a large void. The Hubble diagram inferred from lines of sight originating at the center of the void may be misinterpreted to indicate cosmic acceleration. Current limits on spectral distortions are shown to exclude the largest voids which mimic cosmic acceleration. More sensitive measurements of the CMB spectrum could prove the existence of such a void or confirm the validity of the Copernican principle.},

abstract = {Assuming the universe is spatially homogeneous on the largest scales lays the foundation for almost all cosmology. This idea is based on the Copernican principle, that we are not at a particularly special place in the universe. Surprisingly, this philosophical assumption has yet to be rigorously demonstrated independently of the standard paradigm. This issue has been brought to light by cosmological models which can potentially explain apparent acceleration by spatial inhomogeneity rather than dark energy. These models replace the temporal fine tuning associated with Lambda with a spatial fine tuning, and so violate the Copernican assumption. While is seems unlikely that such models can really give a realistic solution to the dark energy problem, they do reveal how poorly constrained radial inhomogeneity actually is. So the bigger issue remains: How do we robustly test the Copernican principle independently of dark energy or theory of gravity?},

It includes 11,663 deg2 of imaging data, with most of the {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}2000 deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120° long, 2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.},

abstract = {We present an improved prescription for matter power spectrum in redshift space taking a proper account of both the non-linear gravitational clustering and redshift distortion, which are of particular importance for accurately modeling baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). Contrary to the models of redshift distortion phenomenologically introduced but frequently used in the literature, the new model includes the corrections arising from the non-linear coupling between the density and velocity fields associated with two competitive effects of redshift distortion, i.e., Kaiser and Finger-of-God effects. Based on the improved treatment of perturbation theory for gravitational clustering, we compare our model predictions with monopole and quadrupole power spectra of N-body simulations, and an excellent agreement is achieved over the scales of BAOs. Potential impacts on constraining dark energy and modified gravity from the redshift-space power spectrum are also investigated based on the Fisher-matrix formalism. We find that the existing phenomenological models of redshift distortion produce a systematic error on measurements of the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter by 1{\~{}}2{\%}, and the growth rate parameter by {\~{}}5{\%}, which would become non-negligible for future galaxy surveys. Correctly modeling redshift distortion is thus essential, and the new prescription of redshift-space power spectrum including the non-linear corrections can be used as an accurate theoretical template for anisotropic BAOs.},

abstract = {We analyse the clustering of 22 361 quasars between redshift 2.2 {\textless}z {\textless}2.9 observed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), which are included in the ninth data release (DR9). We fit the clustering results with a $\Lambda$cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model to calculate the linear bias of the quasar sample, b = 3.74 ± 0.12. The measured value of bias is consistent with the findings of White et al., where they analyse almost the same quasar sample, although only in the range s {\textless}40 h−1 Mpc. At large scales we observe an excess or plateau in the clustering correlation function. By fitting a model that incorporates a scale dependent additional term in the bias introduced by primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type, we calculate the amplitude of the deviation from the Gaussian initial conditions as 70 {\textless}fNLlocal {\textless}190 at the 95 per cent confidence level. We correct the sample from systematics according to the methods of Ross et al. and Ho et al., with the fNLlocal measurements after the application of the two methods being consistent with each other. Finally, we use cross-correlations across redshift slices to test the corrected sample for any remaining unknown sources of systematics, but the results give no indication of any such further errors. We consider as our final results on non-Gaussianity, 46 {\textless}fNLlocal {\textless}158 at 95 per cent confidence, after correcting the sample with the weights method of Ross et al. These results are consistent with previous tight constraints on non-Gaussianity from other Large-Scale Structures surveys, but are in tension with the latest results from the cosmic microwave background.},

abstract = {Standard models of galaxy formation predict that matter distribution is statistically homogeneous and isotropic and characterized by (i) spatial homogeneity for r {\textless}10 Mpc h−1, (ii) small-amplitude structures of relatively limited size (i.e. r {\textless}100) Mpc h−1 and (iii) anti-correlations for r {\textgreater}rc ≈ 150 Mpc h−1 (i.e. no structures of size larger than rc). Whether or not the observed galaxy distribution is interpreted to be compatible with these predictions depends on the a priori assumptions encoded in the statistical methods employed to characterize the data and on the a posteriori hypotheses made to interpret the results. We present strategies to test the most common assumptions and we find evidence that, in the available samples, galaxy distribution is spatially inhomogeneous for r {\textless}100 Mpc h−1 but statistically homogeneous and isotropic. We conclude that the observed inhomogeneities pose a fundamental challenge to the standard picture of cosmology but they also represent an important opportunity which may open new directions for many cosmological puzzles.},

abstract = {We present predictions for the cosmic metal budget in various phases of baryons from redshift z = 6 -{\textgreater}0, taken from a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that includes a well-constrained model for enriched galactic outflows. We find that substantial amounts of metals are found in every baryonic phase at all epochs, with diffuse intergalactic gas dominating the metal budget at early epochs and stars and halo gas dominating at recent epochs. We provide a full accounting of metals in the context of the missing metals problem at z 2.5, showing that 40 per cent of the metals are in galaxies, and the remainder are divided between diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) gas and shocked gas in haloes and filamentary structures. Comparisons with available observations of metallicity and metal mass fraction evolution show broad agreement. We predict that stars have a mean metallicity of one-tenth solar already at z = 6, which increases slowly to one-half solar today, while stars just forming today typically have solar metallicity. Our HI column density weighted mean metallicity (comparable to damped Lyman $\alpha$ system metallicities) slowly increases from one-tenth to one-third solar from z = 6 -{\textgreater}1, and then falls to one-quarter solar at z = 0. The global mean metallicity of the universe tracks 50 per cent higher than that of the diffuse phase down to z 1, and by z = 0 it has a value around one-tenth solar. Metals move towards higher densities and temperatures with time, peaking around the mean cosmic density at z = 2 and an overdensity of 100 at z = 0. We study how carbon and oxygen ions trace the path of metals in phase space, and show that OIII-OVII lines provide the most-practical option for constraining IGM metals at z {\textless}2.},

However, considered together, one data set resolves the difficulties of the other, allowing certain degenerate parameters to be determined with far greater precision. We treat in detail the degeneracies involving the classical cosmological parameters, massive neutrinos, tensor-scalar ratio, bias, and reionization optical depth as well as how redshift surveys can resolve them. We discuss the opportunities for internal and external consistency checks on these measurements. Previous papers on parameter estimation have generally treated smaller parameter spaces; in direct comparisons to these works, we tend to find weaker constraints and suggest numerical explanations for the discrepancies.},

abstract = {We present new measurements of the quasar angular autocorrelation 
function from a sample of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}80,000 photometrically classified quasars
taken from the First Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We
find a best-fit model of
$\omega$($\theta$)=(0.066+0.026-0.024)$\theta$-(0.98+/-0.15)
for the angular correlation function, consistent with estimates of the
slope from spectroscopic quasar surveys. We show that only models with
little or no evolution in the clustering of quasars in comoving
coordinates since a median redshift of z{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}1.4 can recover a scale length
consistent with local galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). A
model with little evolution of quasar clustering in comoving coordinates
is best explained in the current cosmological paradigm by rapid
evolution in quasar bias. We show that quasar biasing must have changed
from bQ{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}3 at a (photometric) redshift of
z¯phot=2.2 to bQ{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}1.2-1.3 by
z¯phot=0.75. Such a rapid increase with redshift in
biasing implies that quasars at z{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}2 cannot be the progenitors of modern
L* objects; rather they must now reside in dense environments, such as
clusters. Similarly, the duration of the UVX (ultraviolet-excess) quasar
phase must be short enough to explain why local UVX quasars reside in
essentially unbiased structures. Our estimates of bQ are in
good agreement with recent spectroscopic results (Croom et al. 2005),
which demonstrate that the implied evolution in bQ is
consistent with quasars inhabiting halos of similar mass at every
redshift. Treating quasar clustering as a bivariate function of both
redshift and luminosity, we find no evidence for luminosity dependence
in quasar clustering, and that redshift evolution thus affects quasar
clustering more than changes in quasars' luminosity. Our results are
robust against a range of systematic uncertainties. We provide a new
method for quantifying stellar contamination in photometrically
classified quasar catalogs via the correlation function.},

abstract = {We report a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the flux-correlation function of the Ly{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} forest of high-redshift quasars with a statistical significance of five standard deviations. The study uses 137,562 quasars in the redshift range {\$}2.1\backslashle z \backslashle 3.5{\$} from the Data Release 11 (DR11) of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of SDSS-III. This sample contains three times the number of quasars used in previous studies. The measured position of the BAO peak determines the angular distance, {\$}D{\_}A(z=2.34){\$} and expansion rate, {\$}H(z=2.34){\$}, both on a scale set by the sound horizon at the drag epoch, {\$}r{\_}d{\$}. We find {\$}D{\_}A/r{\_}d=11.28\backslashpm0.65(1\backslashsigma){\^{}}{\{}+2.8{\}}{\_}{\{}-1.2{\}}(2\backslashsigma){\$} and {\$}D{\_}H/r{\_}d=9.18\backslashpm0.28(1\backslashsigma)\backslashpm0.6(2\backslashsigma){\$} where {\$}D{\_}H=c/H{\$}. The optimal combination, {\$}\backslashsim D{\_}H{\^{}}{\{}0.7{\}}D{\_}A{\^{}}{\{}0.3{\}}/r{\_}d{\$} is determined with a precision of {\$}\backslashsim2\backslash{\%}{\$}. For the value {\$}r{\_}d=147.4{\~{}}{\{}\backslashrm Mpc{\}}{\$}, consistent with the CMB power spectrum measured by Planck, we find {\$}D{\_}A(z=2.34)=1662\backslashpm96(1\backslashsigma){\~{}}{\{}\backslashrm Mpc{\}}{\$} and {\$}H(z=2.34)=222\backslashpm7(1\backslashsigma){\~{}}{\{}\backslashrm km\backslash,s{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}Mpc{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\}}{\$}. Tests with mock catalogs and variations of our analysis procedure have revealed no systematic uncertainties comparable to our statistical errors. Our results agree with the previously reported BAO measurement at the same redshift using the quasar-Ly{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} forest cross-correlation. The auto-correlation and cross-correlation approaches are complementary because of the quite different impact of redshift-space distortion on the two measurements. The combined constraints from the two correlation functions imply values of {\$}D{\_}A/r{\_}d{\$} and {\$}D{\_}H/r{\_}d{\$} that are, respectively, 7{\%} low and 7{\%} high compared to the predictions of a flat {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM cosmological model with the best-fit Planck parameters. With our estimated statistical errors, the significance of this discrepancy is {\$}\backslashapprox 2.5\backslashsigma{\$}.},

abstract = {The usual idealizations in cosmology, which are used with the general theory of relativity for deriving the cosmological equations, lead to the idea of a partitioned universe and to the boundary conditions necessary for isolating a small region or cell of space. An isolated cell, infinitesimally small and embedded in flat space, forms the basis of a microcosmic model of the universe. An internal observer perceives an expanding unbounded universe and applies the same theoretical concepts commonly used in macrocosmic models. He is also free to work within the framework of special relativity theory, and from the first law of thermodynamics and the equations of hydrodynamics is able to derive the cosmological equations without the aid of general relativity and without making any approximations. The application of the cosmological principle to a universe containing a uniform perfect fluid accounts for the complete equivalence of the microcosmic model with the usual macrocosmic models. In many of its properties the microcosmic model closely resembles Newtonian cosmology; it avoids however the ambiguous nature of the gravititional field in a uniform unbounded fluid and is also not limited in its treatment to a pressure-free universe.},

The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer is mapping the whole sky following its launch on 14 December 2009. WISE began surveying the sky on 14 Jan 2010 and completed its first full coverage of the sky on July 17. The survey will continue to cover the sky a second time until the cryogen is exhausted (anticipated in November 2010). WISE is achieving 5 sigma point source sensitivities better than 0.08, 0.11, 1 and 6 mJy in unconfused regions on the ecliptic in bands centered at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 microns. Sensitivity improves toward the ecliptic poles due to denser coverage and lower zodiacal background. The angular resolution is 6.1, 6.4, 6.5 and 12.0 arc-seconds at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 microns, and the astrometric precision for high SNR sources is better than 0.15 arc-seconds.},

abstract = {The unknown nature of `dark energy' motivates continued cosmological 
tests of large-scale gravitational physics. We present a new consistency
check based on the relative amplitude of non-relativistic galaxy
peculiar motions, measured via redshift-space distortion, and the
relativistic deflection of light by those same galaxies traced by
galaxy-galaxy lensing. We take advantage of the latest generation of
deep, overlapping imaging and spectroscopic data sets, combining the Red
Cluster Sequence Lensing Survey, the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope
Lensing Survey, the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey and the Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We quantify the results using the
`gravitational slip' statistic EG, which we estimate as 0.48
± 0.10 at z = 0.32 and 0.30 ± 0.07 at z = 0.57, the latter
constituting the highest redshift at which this quantity has been
determined. These measurements are consistent with the predictions of
General Relativity, for a perturbed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric in
a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant, which are EG
= 0.41 and 0.36 at these respective redshifts. The combination of
redshift-space distortion and gravitational lensing data from current
and future galaxy surveys will offer increasingly stringent tests of
fundamental cosmology.},

abstract = {We present the SDSS-XDQSO quasar targeting catalog for efficient flux-based quasar target selection down to the faint limit of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalog, even at medium redshifts (2.5 {\textless}{\~{}} z {\textless}{\~{}} 3) where the stellar contamination is significant. We build models of the distributions of stars and quasars in flux space down to the flux limit by applying the extreme-deconvolution method to estimate the underlying density. We convolve this density with the flux uncertainties when evaluating the probability that an object is a quasar. This approach results in a targeting algorithm that is more principled, more efficient, and faster than other similar methods. We apply the algorithm to derive low-redshift (z {\textless} 2.2), medium-redshift (2.2 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 3.5), and high-redshift (z {\textgreater} 3.5) quasar probabilities for all 160,904,060 point sources with dereddened i-band magnitude between 17.75 and 22.45 mag in the 14,555 deg{\^{}}2 of imaging from SDSS Data Release 8. The catalog can be used to define a uniformly selected and efficient low- or medium-redshift quasar survey, such as that needed for the SDSS-III's Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey project. We show that the XDQSO technique performs as well as the current best photometric quasar-selection technique at low redshift, and outperforms all other flux-based methods for selecting the medium-redshift quasars of our primary interest. We make code to reproduce the XDQSO quasar target selection publicly available.},

The measurement uses the complete Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) data sample: 168 889 forests and 234 367 quasars from the SDSS data release DR12. In addition to the statistical improvement on our previous study using DR11, we have implemented numerous improvements at the analysis level enabling a more accurate measurement of this cross-correlation. We have also developed the first simulations of the cross-correlation that allow us to test different aspects of our data analysis and to search for potential systematic errors in the determination of the BAO peak position. We measure the two ratios {\textless}i{\textgreater}D{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}H{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater}= 2.40) /{\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}d{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}= 9.01 ± 0.36 and {\textless}i{\textgreater}D{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}M{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater}= 2.40) /{\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}d{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}= 35.7 ± 1.7, where the errors include marginalization over the non-linear velocity of quasars and the cross-correlation of metals and quasars, among other effects. These results are within 1.8{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\sigma${\textless}i/{\textgreater}of the prediction of the flat-$\Lambda$CDM model describing the observed cosmic microwave background anisotropies.

We introduce a new approach which allows us to place limits on the presence of localized structures within essentially our entire observable volume, using cosmic microwave background secondary anisotropies. We find that structures cannot exceed roughly 20 times their expected amplitude over most of our observable volume. Similarly, we place tight constraints on statistical inhomogeneity within our volume, performing the first power spectrum reconstruction using secondary anisotropies alone. We find that the standard model passes this important new consistency test. Our approach probes homogeneity over vastly larger volumes and scales than previous studies based on surveys.},

abstract = {We present the first measurement of the large-scale cross-correlation of Ly$\alpha$ forest absorption and Damped Lyman $\alpha$ systems (DLA), using the 9th Data Release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). The cross-correlation is clearly detected on scales up to 40h−1Mpc and is well fitted by the linear theory prediction of the standard Cold Dark Matter model of structure formation with the expected redshift distortions, confirming its origin in the gravitational evolution of structure. The amplitude of the DLA-Ly$\alpha$ cross-correlation depends on only one free parameter, the bias factor of the DLA systems, once the Ly$\alpha$ forest bias factors are known from independent Ly$\alpha$ forest correlation measurements. We measure the DLA bias factor to be bD = (2.17±0.20)$\beta$F0.22, where the Ly$\alpha$ forest redshift distortion parameter $\beta$F is expected to be above unity. This bias factor implies a typical host halo mass for DLAs that is much larger than expected in present DLA models, and is reproduced if the DLA cross section scales with halo mass as Mh$\alpha$, with $\alpha$ = 1.1±0.1 for $\beta$F = 1. Matching the observed DLA bias factor and rate of incidence requires that atomic gas remains extended in massive halos over larger areas than predicted in present simulations of galaxy formation, with typical DLA proper sizes larger than 20 kpc in host halos of masses {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 1012M☉. We infer that typical galaxies at z 2 to 3 are surrounded by systems of atomic clouds that are much more extended than the luminous parts of galaxies and contain {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 10{\%} of the baryons in the host halo.},

abstract = {Cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies have and will continue to revolutionize our understanding of cosmology. The recent discovery of the previously predicted acoustic peaks in the power spectrum has established a working cosmological model: a critical density universe consisting of mainly dark matter and dark energy, which formed its structure through gravitational instability from quantum fluctuations during an inflationary epoch. Future observations should test this model and measure its key cosmological parameters with unprecedented precision. The phenomenology and cosmological implications of the acoustic peaks are developed in detail. Beyond the peaks, the yet to be detected secondary anisotropies and polarization present
opportunities to study the physics of inflation and the dark energy. The analysis techniques devised to extract cosmological information from voluminous CMB data sets are outlined, given their increasing importance in experimental cosmology as a whole.},

Data Release 9 (DR9) sample, which consists of 264 283 galaxies in the
redshift range 0.43 {\textless}z {\textless}0.7 spanning 3275 deg2. Both
peculiar velocities and errors in the assumed redshift-distance relation
('Alcock-Paczynski effect') generate correlations between clustering
amplitude and orientation with respect to the line of sight. Together
with the sharp baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) standard ruler, our
measurements of the broad-band shape of the monopole and quadrupole
correlation functions simultaneously constrain the comoving angular
diameter distance (2190 ± 61 Mpc) to z = 0.57, the Hubble
expansion rate at z = 0.57 (92.4 ± 4.5 km s-1
Mpc-1) and the growth rate of structure at that same redshift
(d$\sigma$8/d ln a = 0.43 ± 0.069). Our analysis
provides the best current direct determination of both DA and
H in galaxy clustering data using this technique. If we further assume a
$\Lambda$cold dark matter expansion history, our growth constraint
tightens to d$\sigma$8/d ln a = 0.415 ± 0.034. In
combination with the cosmic microwave background, our measurements of
DA, H and d$\sigma$8/d ln a all separately require
dark energy at z {\textgreater}0.57, and when combined imply
$\Omega$$\Lambda$ = 0.74 ± 0.016, independent of the
Universe's evolution at z {\textless}0.57. All of these constraints assume
scale-independent linear growth, and assume general relativity to
compute both O(10 per cent) non-linear model corrections and our errors.
In our companion paper, Samushia et al., we explore further cosmological
implications of these observations.},

These use the Data Release 9 (DR9) CMASS sample, which contains 264 283 massive galaxies covering 3275 square degrees with an effective redshift z = 0.57 and redshift range 0.43 {\textless}z {\textless}0.7. Assuming a concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, this sample covers an effective volume of 2.2 Gpc3, and represents the largest sample of the Universe ever surveyed at this density, . We measure the angle-averaged galaxy correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of 5$\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Combining with the SDSS-II luminous red galaxy sample, the detection significance increases to 6.7$\sigma$. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance to z = 0.57 relative to the sound horizon DV/rs = 13.67 ± 0.22 at z = 0.57. Assuming a fiducial sound horizon of 153.19 Mpc, which matches cosmic microwave background constraints, this corresponds to a distance DV (z = 0.57) = 2094 ± 34 Mpc. At 1.7 per cent, this is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. We place this result alongside previous BAO measurements in a cosmological distance ladder and find excellent agreement with the current supernova measurements. We use these distance measurements to constrain various cosmological models, finding continuing support for a flat Universe with a cosmological constant.},

abstract = {We present the SDSS-XDQSO quasar targeting catalog for efficient flux-based quasar target selection down to the faint limit of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalog, even at medium redshifts (2.5 {\textless}{\~{}} z {\textless}{\~{}} 3) where the stellar contamination is significant. We build models of the distributions of stars and quasars in flux space down to the flux limit by applying the extreme-deconvolution method to estimate the underlying density. We convolve this density with the flux uncertainties when evaluating the probability that an object is a quasar. This approach results in a targeting algorithm that is more principled, more efficient, and faster than other similar methods. We apply the algorithm to derive low-redshift (z {\textless} 2.2), medium-redshift (2.2 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 3.5), and high-redshift (z {\textgreater} 3.5) quasar probabilities for all 160,904,060 point sources with dereddened i-band magnitude between 17.75 and 22.45 mag in the 14,555 deg{\^{}}2 of imaging from SDSS Data Release 8. The catalog can be used to define a uniformly selected and efficient low- or medium-redshift quasar survey, such as that needed for the SDSS-III's Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey project. We show that the XDQSO technique performs as well as the current best photometric quasar-selection technique at low redshift, and outperforms all other flux-based methods for selecting the medium-redshift quasars of our primary interest. We make code to reproduce the XDQSO quasar target selection publicly available.},

@article{croom_2df_2001,
abstract = {In this paper we present a clustering analysis of QSOs over the redshift range z=0.3-2.9. We use a sample of 10558 QSOs taken from the
preliminary data release catalogue of the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ). The two-point redshift-space correlation function of QSOs,
$\xi$Q(s), is shown to follow a power law on scales
s{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}=1-35h-1Mpc. Fitting a power law of the form
$\xi$Q(s)=(s/s0)-$\gamma$ to the QSO
clustering averaged over the redshift interval 0.30=3.99-0.34+0.28h-1Mpc and $\gamma$=1.58-0.09+0.10 for an Einstein-de Sitter cosmology. The effect of a significant cosmological constant, $\lambda$0, is to increase the
separation of QSOs, so that with $\Omega$0=0.3,
$\lambda$0=0.7 the power law extends to {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}=60h-1Mpc and the best fit is s0=5.69-0.50+0.42h-1Mpc and $\gamma$=1.56-0.09+0.10. These values, measured at a mean redshift of
z=1.49, are comparable to the clustering of local optically selected galaxies. We compare the clustering of 2QZ QSOs with generic cold dark matter (CDM) models with shape parameter $\Gamma$eff. Standard CDM with $\Gamma$eff=0.5 is ruled out in both Einstein-de
Sitter and cosmological constant dominated cosmologies, where
$\Gamma$eff{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}=0.2-0.4 and $\Gamma$eff{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}=0.1-0.2
respectively are the allowable ranges. We measure the evolution of QSO clustering as a function of redshift. For $\Omega$0=1 and
$\lambda$0=0 there is no significant evolution in comoving
coordinates over the redshift range of the 2QZ. QSOs thus have similar clustering properties to local galaxies at all redshifts that we sample. In the case of $\Omega$0=0.3 and $\lambda$0=0.7, QSO
clustering shows a marginal increase at high redshift, s0 being a factor of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}1.4 higher at z{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}=2.4 than at z{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}=0.7. Although the clustering of QSOs is measured on large scales where linear theory should apply, the evolution of QSO clustering does not follow the linear theory predictions for growth via gravitational instability (rejected at the {\textgreater}99 per cent confidence level). A redshift-dependent bias is required to reconcile QSO clustering observations with theory. A simple biasing model, in which QSOs have cosmologically long lifetimes (or alternatively form in peaks above a constant threshold in the density field), is acceptable in an $\Omega$0=1 cosmology, but is only marginally acceptable if $\Omega$0=0.3 and
$\lambda$0=0.7. Biasing models in which QSOs are assumed to
form over a range in redshift, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, are consistent with QSO clustering evolution for a minimum halo mass of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}1012 and {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}1013Msolar in an Einstein-de Sitter and cosmological constant dominated universe, respectively. However, until an accurate, physically motivated model of QSO formation and evolution is developed, we should be cautious in interpreting the fits to these biasing models.},

abstract = {This is an expansion of an analysis that first appeared in Peacock (2001), but which has not previously been available online, except at www.roe.ac.uk/japwww. Some more details, particularly analytic solutions for test-particle motion in open and closed models, are given by Whiting (2004). Some relevant further discussion is given by Barnes et al. (2006). 1 The meaning of an expanding universe The idea of an expanding universe can easily lead to confusion, and this note tries to counter some of the more tenacious misconceptions. The worst of these is the 'expanding space' fallacy. The RW metric written in comoving coordinates emphasizes that one can think of any given fundamental observer as fixed in a coordinate system where separations increase in proportion to R(t). A common interpretation of this algebra is to say that the galaxies separate " because the space between them expands " , or some such phrase. This seems a natural interpretation, but we need to worry about what the coordinates mean, as may be seen via two examples: the empty universe and de Sitter space. In the former case, Minkowski spacetime is rewritten as an expanding open RW metric with R(t) ∝ t. In the latter case, we can compare the usual metric for de Sitter space c 2 d$\tau$ 2 = c 2 dt 2 − R 2 (t) dr 2 + r 2 d$\psi$ 2 ; R(t) ∝ e},

abstract = {Quasars that exhibit blue-shifted, broad absorption lines (BAL QSOs) are an important probe of black hole feedback on galaxy evolution. Yet the presence of BALs is also a complication for large, spectroscopic surveys that use quasars as cosmological probes because the BAL features can affect redshift measurements and contaminate information about the matter distribution in the Lyman-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} forest. We present a new BAL QSO catalog for quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 14 (DR14). As the SDSS DR14 quasar catalog has over 500,000 quasars, we have developed an automated BAL classifier with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We trained our CNN classifier on the C IV {\$}\backslashlambda 1549{\$} region of a sample of quasars with reliable human classifications, and compared the results to both a dedicated test sample and visual classifications from the earlier SDSS DR12 quasar catalog. Our CNN classifier correctly classifies over 98{\%} of the BAL quasars in the DR12 catalog, which demonstrates comparable reliability to human classification. The disagreements are generally for quasars with lower signal-to-noise ratio spectra and/or weaker BAL features. Our new catalog includes the probability that each quasar is a BAL, the strength, blueshifts and velocity widths of the troughs, and similar information for any Si IV {\$}\backslashlambda 1398{\$} BAL troughs that may be present. We find significant BAL features in 16.8{\%} of all quasars with {\$}1.57 {\textless} z {\textless} 5.56{\$} in the SDSS DR14 quasar catalog.},

@article{bouche_missing_2007,
abstract = {We revisit the metal budget at z = 2, and include the contribution of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Past estimates of the metal budget have indicated that, at redshift z = 2.5, 90 per cent of the expected metals were missing. In the first two papers of this series, we have already shown that 30 per cent of the metals are observed in all z 2.5 galaxies detected in current surveys. This fraction could increase to {\textless}60 per cent if we extrapolate the faint end of the luminosity function (LF), leaving {\textgreater}40 per cent of the metals missing. Here, we extend our analysis to the metals outside galaxies (i.e. in the IGM), using (i) observational data and (ii) analytical calculations. Our results for both are strikingly similar. (i) Observationally, we find that, besides the small (5 per cent) contribution of damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs), the forest and sub-DLAs contribute substantially to make {\textless}30-45 per cent of the metal budget; however, neither of these appear to be sufficient to close the metal budget. The forest accounts for 15-30 per cent depending on the ultraviolet background, and sub-DLAs for {\textgreater}2 to {\textless}17 per cent depending on the ionization fraction. Combining the metals in galaxies and in the IGM, it appears now that {\textgreater}65 per cent of the metals have been accounted for, and the `missing metals problem' is substantially eased. (ii) We perform analytical calculations based on the effective yield-mass (yeff-Vc) relation, whose deficit for small galaxies is considered as evidence for supernova-driven outflows. As a test of the method, we show that, at z = 0, the calculation self-consistently predicts the total amount of metals expelled from galaxies. At z = 2, we find that the method predicts that 25-50 per cent of the metals have been ejected from galaxies into the IGM, consistent with the observations ({\textless}35 per cent). The metal ejection is predominantly by LB {\textless}(1/3) L*B(z = 2) galaxies, which are responsible for 90 per cent of the metal enrichment, while the 50 percentile is at L (1/10) L*B (z = 2). As a consequence, if indeed 50 per cent of the metals have been ejected from galaxies, three to five bursts of star formation are required per galaxy prior to z = 2. The ratio between the mass of metals outside galaxies to those in stars has changed from z = 2 to z = 0; it was 1: 2 or 1: 1 and is now 1: 8 or 1: 9. This evolution implies that a significant fraction of the IGM metals will cool and fall back into galaxies.},

We perform our analysis in Fourier space using a power spectrum estimator suggested by Yamamoto et al. We measure the multipole power spectra in a self-consistent manner for the first time in the sense that we provide a proper way to treat the survey window function and the integral constraint, without the commonly used assumption of an isotropic power spectrum and without the need to split the survey into subregions. The main cosmological signals exploited in our analysis are the baryon acoustic oscillations and the signal of redshift space distortions, both of which are distorted by the Alcock–Paczynski effect. Together, these signals allow us to constrain the distance ratio DV(zeff)/rs(zd) = 13.89 ± 0.18, the Alcock–Paczynski parameter FAP(zeff) = 0.679 ± 0.031 and the growth rate of structure f (zeff)$\sigma$8(zeff) = 0.419 ± 0.044 at the effective redshift zeff = 0.57. We emphasize that our constraints are robust against possible systematic uncertainties. In order to ensure this, we perform a detailed systematics study against CMASS mock galaxy catalogues and N-body simulations. We find that such systematics will lead to 3.1 per cent uncertainty for f$\sigma$8 if we limit our fitting range to k = 0.01–0.20 h Mpc−1, where the statistical uncertainty is expected to be three times larger. We did not find significant systematic uncertainties for DV/rs or FAP. Combining our data set with Planck to test General Relativity (GR) through the simple $\gamma$-parametrization, where the growth rate is given by f(z)=$\Omega$$\gamma$m(z)f(z) = {\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}Omega {\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}$\backslash${\{}{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}gamma {\}}{\_}$\backslash${\{}{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}rm m{\}}(z), reveals a ∼2$\sigma$ tension between the data and the prediction by GR. The tension between our result and GR can be traced back to a tension in the clustering amplitude $\sigma$8 between CMASS and Planck.},

@article{Bridle1994,
abstract = {A representative sample of 12 extended quasars from the 3CR catalog has been imaged at 4.9 GHz using the VLA. These full synthesis observations typically achieve an rms noise of 20 mu Jy per beam, at a resolution (FWHM) of 0.''34 to 0.''38. Jets are detected on at least one side of every source. The jets are well collimated compared with those in less powerful sources, but spreading is detected in most of them. The opening angles of several jets are not constant, but show recollimation after an initial regime of rapid spreading. Many of the jets contain quasiperiodic strings of knots, of which the knot closest to the central feature is usually the brightest (until the jet nears its hot spot). The degrees of linear polarization at the jet knots range from {\{}{\textless}{\}}5{\%} to similar to 50{\%}, but show no common trend with distance along the jets. In knots that are elongated in directions close to that of the jet, the E vectors tend to be orthogonal to the jet axis. The exceptions-misaligned knots with misaligned polarizations-tend to be bright features near large bends in the jets. Many of the jets are initially straight to within a few degrees, but bend more in the outer part of the source. The prominence of the inner, straighter jet segments relative to the extended lobes correlates significantly with the prominence of the milliarcsecond-scale central features, but the prominence of the more bent jet segments does not. Candidates for counterjet emission are detected in seven sources, but there is no unambiguous, continuous counterjet in any of them. Estimates of the flux density ratios between the straighter jet segments and the counterjets based on these tentative detections range from 1.2:1 to {\{}{\textgreater}{\}}175:1. There is no evidence in this sample that counterjet detectability correlates with such putative inclination indicators as central feature prominence or projected linear size. There is also no evidence that the prominence of the counterjets anticorrelates with that of the jets as predicted by simple relativistic-beaming models for the jet/counterjet asymmetry. There is, however, strong evidence that large bends in the main jet favor counterjet detection, and there are no counterjet candidates opposite long, uninterrupted straight segments of the main jets.The detectability of the counterjets in these quasars may therefore be strongly influenced by interactions between the underlying beams and inhomogeneities in the surrounding material. We offer a new empirical definition of the term ''hot spot'' that is intended to improve the distinction between such features and ''jet knots.'' Both the compactness of hot spots and their position in the lobe are affected by whether they are fed by a detectable jet. When the hot spots differ significantly in compactness, the more compact one is always on the jetted side. Jetted hot spots are also more likely to be recessed deeply from the outer edge of their lobes than are their counterjetted counterparts. The jetted hot spot is less prominent relative to other extended emission if the jet bends through a large angle, particularly if a large bend occurs abruptly. The counterjetted hot spot is also less well defined if the jet is more bent. The lobes of several sources show considerable inhomogeneity, including filamentation.There is little difference in the inhomogeneity of the jetted and counterjetted lobes if the hot spots are excluded. The lobes have a common linear polarization pattern, with low polarization at the center and high polarization (often reaching 40{\%} to 60{\%}) near the edges. This pattern matches the expectations of models in which the magnetic field in the lobes is provided by passively expanding the field in the jets. The lobes in sources with promising counterjet candidates are often S-symmetric relative to the jet axis and their hot spots are more misaligned than in sources without such candidates. Counterjets may therefore be easier to detect if the jets change orientation during the lifetime of the source. We outline the implications of our results for various models of the prominence and asymmetries of central features, jets, counterjets, and hot spots. The correlations between the prominence and sidedness of the large-scale straight jet segments and of the small-scale central features favor models in which the kiloparsec-scale jets initially have bulk relativistic velocities. The slope of the prominence correlation is less than expected if the larger-scale jets have characteristic Lorentz factors as high as those in the milliarcsecond-scale features, however. This result is fragile within our small sample, but other aspects of our data also suggest that another phenomenon, closely coupled to jet bending, helps to determine the prominence of features far from the central region. Overall, our data favor ''tired jet'' models in which the average jet velocity decreases with increasing distance from the central object. This makes it harder for the simplest relativistic-jet models to account for the systematic differences in compactness and placement of jetted and counterjetted hot spots. The models may need refinement to include a range of Lorentz factors in the jets at any given distance from the quasar.},

abstract = {A common belief about big-bang cosmology is that the cosmological redshift cannot be properly viewed as a Doppler shift (that is, as evidence for a recession velocity), but must be viewed in terms of the stretching of space. We argue that, contrary to this view, the most natural interpretation of the redshift is as a Doppler shift, or rather as the accumulation of many infinitesimal Doppler shifts. The stretching-of-space interpretation obscures a central idea of relativity, namely that it is always valid to choose a coordinate system that is locally Minkowskian. We show that an observed frequency shift in any spacetime can be interpreted either as a kinematic (Doppler) shift or a gravitational shift by imagining a suitable family of observers along the photon's path. In the context of the expanding universe the kinematic interpretation corresponds to a family of comoving observers and hence is more natural.},

@article{myers_clustering_2007,
abstract = {Using {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}300,000 photometrically classified quasars, by far the largest 
quasar sample ever used for such analyses, we study the redshift and
luminosity evolution of quasar clustering on scales of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}50
h-1 kpc to {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}20 h-1 Mpc from redshifts of
z¯{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.75-2.28. We parameterize our clustering amplitudes using
realistic dark matter models and find that a $\Lambda$CDM power spectrum
provides a superb fit to our data with a redshift-averaged quasar bias
of bz¯=1.40Q=2.41+/-0.08
(P{\textless}$\chi$2=0.847) for $\sigma$8=0.9.
This represents a better fit than the best-fit power-law model
[$\omega$=(0.0493+/-0.0064)$\theta$-0.928+/-0.055
P{\textless}$\chi$2=0.482]. We find bQ
increases with redshift. This evolution is significant at {\textgreater}99.6{\%}
using our data set alone, increasing to {\textgreater}99.9999{\%} if stellar
contamination is not explicitly parameterized. We measure the quasar
classification efficiency across our full sample as
a=95.6+/-4.41.9{\%}, a star-quasar separation
comparable to the star-galaxy separation in many photometric studies of
galaxy clustering. We derive the mean mass of the dark matter halos
hosting quasars as MDMH=(5.2+/-0.6)×1012
h-1 Msolar. At z¯{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}1.9 we find a 1.5 $\sigma$
deviation from luminosity-independent quasar clustering; this suggests
that increasing our sample size by a factor of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}1.8 could begin to
constrain any luminosity dependence in quasar bias at z{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}2. Our results
agree with recent studies of quasar environments at z{\textless}0.4, which
detected little luminosity dependence to quasar clustering on proper
scales {\textgreater}{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}50 h-1 kpc. At z{\textless}1.6, our analysis suggests
that bQ is constant with luminosity to within
$\Delta$bQ{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.6, and that, for g{\textless}21, angular quasar
autocorrelation measurements are unlikely to have sufficient statistical
power at z{\textless}{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}1.6 to detect any luminosity dependence in quasars'
clustering.},

abstract = {Large surveys using multiobject spectrographs require automated methods for deciding how to efficiently point observations and how to assign targets to each pointing. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) will observe around 106 spectra from targets distributed over an area of about 10,000 deg2, using a multiobject fiber spectrograph that can simultaneously observe 640 objects in a circular field of view (referred to as a tile) 149 in radius. No two fibers can be placed closer than 55'' during the same observation; multiple targets closer than this distance are said to collide. We present here a method of allocating fibers to desired targets given a set of tile centers that includes the effects of collisions and that is nearly optimally efficient and uniform. Because of large-scale structure in the galaxy distribution (which form the bulk of the SDSS targets), a naive covering of the sky with equally spaced tiles does not yield uniform sampling. Thus, we present a heuristic for perturbing the centers of the tiles from the equally spaced distribution that provides more uniform completeness. For the SDSS sample, we can attain a sampling rate of greater than 92{\%} for all targets, and greater than 99{\%} for the set of targets that do not collide with each other, with an efficiency greater than 90{\%} (defined as the fraction of available fibers assigned to targets). The methods used here may prove useful to those planning other large surveys.},
annote = {Summary
1) in the case where the tile locations are fixed
Tilling algorithm selects decollided targets (fig 2)
Use network flow algorithm to obtain the best possible assignment of fibers for this set of targets. (fig 1)
Another network flow assign remaining fibers to not decollided targets in tile overlap (fig 3). This is done optimally for binary and triple groups. Less than 1{\%} of targets are in larger collision groups.
2) Start with uniformly distributed tiles and iteratively perturb the positions to reach a better distribution.},

abstract = {Fisher matrices are used frequently in the analysis of combining cosmological constraints from various data sets. They encode the Gaussian uncertainties of multiple variables. They are simple to use, and I show how to get up and running with them quickly. Python software is also provided. I cover how to obtain confidence ellipses, add datasets, apply priors, marginalize, transform variables, and even calculate your own Fisher matrices. This treatment is not new, but I aim to provide a clear and concise reference guide. I also provide references and links to more sophisticated treatments and software.},

Data from the Far-Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) show that the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background is that of a black body of temperature T = 2.73 ± 0.06 K, with no deviation from a black-body spectrum greater than 0.25{\%} of the peak brightness. The data from the Differential Microwave Radiometers (DMR) show statistically significant cosmic microwave background anisotropy, consistent with a scale-invariant primordial density fluctuation spectrum. Measurements from the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) provide new conservative upper limits to the cosmic infrared background. Extensive modeling of solar system and galactic infrared foregrounds is required for further improvement in the cosmic infrared background limits.},

abstract = {Observations of the redshift z=7.085 quasar J1120+0641 have been used to search for variations of the fine structure constant, alpha, over the redshift range 5.5 to 7.1. Observations at z=7.1 probe the physics of the universe when it was only 0.8 billion years old. These are the most distant direct measurements of alpha to date and the first measurements made with a near-IR spectrograph. A new AI analysis method has been employed. Four measurements from the X-SHOOTER spectrograph on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) directly constrain any changes in alpha relative to the value measured on Earth (alpha{\_}0). The weighted mean strength of the electromagnetic force over this redshift range in this location in the universe is da/a = (alpha{\_}z - alpha{\_}0)/alpha{\_}0 = (-2.18 +/- 7.27) X 10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}}, i.e. we find no evidence for a temporal change from the 4 new very high redshift measurements. When the 4 new measurements are combined with a large existing sample of lower redshift measurements, a new limit on possible spatial variation of da/a is marginally preferred over a no-variation model at the 3.7 sigma level.},

If large scale radial inhomogeneities have an amplitude large enough to explain the “dark energy” phenomena, the induced kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power spectrum will be much larger than the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and/or South Pole Telescope upper limit.

@article{larson_early_1998,
abstract = {It has frequently been suggested in the literature that the stellar IMF in galaxies was top-heavy at early times. This would be plausible physically if the IMF depended on a mass-scale such as the Jeans mass that was higher at earlier times because of the generally higher temperatures that were present then. In this paper it is suggested, on the basis of current evidence and theory, that the IMF has a universal Salpeter-like form at the upper end, but flattens below a characteristic stellar mass that may vary with time. Much of the evidence that has been attributed to a top-heavy early IMF, including the ubiquitous G-dwarf problem, the high abundance of heavy elements in clusters of galaxies, and the high rate of formation of massive stars in high-redshift galaxies, can be accounted for with such an IMF if the characteristic stellar mass was several times higher during the early stages of galaxy evolution. However, significant variations in the mass-to-light ratios of galaxies and large amounts of dark matter in stellar remnants are not as easily explained in this way, because they require more extreme and less plausible assumptions about the form and variability of the IMF. Metal-free `population III' stars are predicted to have an IMF that consists exclusively of massive stars, and they could help to account for some of the evidence that has been attributed to a top-heavy early IMF, as well as contributing importantly to the energetics and chemical enrichment of the early Universe.},

$\Omega$M = 0.3, and $\Omega$$\Lambda$ = 0.7), and
either display at least one emission line with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) larger than 500 km s-1 or, if not, have interesting/complex absorption features. The catalog also includes known quasars (mostly from SDSS-I and II) that were reobserved by BOSS. The catalog contains 166 583 quasars (74 454 are new discoveries since SDSS-DR9) detected over 6373 deg2 with robust identification and redshift measured by a combination of principal component
eigenspectra. The number of quasars with z {\textgreater}2.15 (117 668) is {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}5 times greater than the number of z {\textgreater}2.15 quasars known prior to BOSS. Redshifts and FWHMs are provided for the strongest emission lines (C iv, C iii, Mg ii). The catalog identifies 16 461 broad absorption line quasars and gives their characteristics. For each object, the catalog presents five-band (u, g, r, i, z) CCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag and information on the optical morphology and selection method. The catalog also contains X-ray, ultraviolet, near-infrared, and radio emission properties of the quasars, when available, from other large-area surveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover the wavelength region 3600-10 500 {\AA} at a spectral resolution in the range 1300 {\textless}R {\textless}2500; the spectra can be retrieved from
the SDSS Catalog Archive Server. We also provide a supplemental list of an additional 2376 quasars that have been identified among the galaxy targets of the SDSS-III/BOSS.

Quasar catalog is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/563/A54},

abstract = {We test the homogeneity of the universe at z {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 0.3 with the luminous red galaxy (LRG) spectroscopic sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. First, the mean number N(R) of LRGs within completely surveyed LRG-centered spheres of comoving radius R is shown to be proportional to R3 at radii greater than R {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 70 h-1 Mpc. The test has the virtue that it does not rely on the assumption that the LRG sample has a finite mean density; its results show, however, that there is such a mean density. Second, the survey sky area is divided into 10 disjoint solid angular regions, and the fractional rms density variations of the LRG sample in the redshift range 0.2 {\textless}z {\textless}0.35 among these ({\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 2 × 107 h-3 Mpc3) regions is found to be 7{\%} of the mean density. This variance is consistent with typical biased $\Lambda$CDM models and puts very strong constraints on the quality of SDSS photometric calibration.},

abstract = {We measure the large-scale cross-correlation of quasars with the Ly$\alpha$ forest absorption, using over 164,000 quasars from Data Release 11 of the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We extend the previous study of roughly 60,000 quasars from Data Release 9 to larger separations, allowing a measurement of the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale along the line of sight c/(H(z = 2.36)rs) = 9.0±0.3 and across the line of sight DA(z = 2.36)/rs = 10.8±0.4, consistent with CMB and other BAO data. Using the best fit value of the sound horizon from Planck data (rs = 147.49 Mpc), we can translate these results to a measurement of the Hubble parameter of H(z = 2.36) = 226±8 km s−1 Mpc−1 and of the angular diameter distance of DA(z = 2.36) = 1590±60 Mpc. The measured cross-correlation function and an update of the code to fit the BAO scale (baofit) are made publicly available.},

abstract = {We report a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the three-dimensional correlation function of the transmitted flux fraction in the $\backslash$Lya forest of high-redshift quasars. The study uses 48,640 quasars in the redshift range {\$}2.1\backslashle z \backslashle 3.5{\$} from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the third generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III).

A peak in the correlation function is seen at a separation equal to {\$}(1.01\backslashpm0.03){\$} times the distance expected for the BAO peak within a concordance {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM cosmology. This first detection of the BAO peak at high redshift, when the universe was strongly matter dominated, results in constraints on the angular diameter distance {\$}\backslashda{\$} and the expansion rate {\$}H{\$} at {\$}z=2.3{\$} that, by themselves, require the existence of dark energy. Combined with constraints derived from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations, this result implies {\$}H(z=2.3)=(224\backslashpm8){\{}\backslashrm km s{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}Mpc{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\}}{\$}, indicating that the time derivative of the cosmological scale parameter {\$}\backslashdot{\{}a{\}}=H(z=2.3)/(1+z){\$} is significantly greater than that measured with BAO at {\$}z\backslashsim0.5{\$}. This demonstrates that the expansion was decelerating in the range {\$}0.7{\textless}z{\textless}2.3{\$}, as expected from the matter domination during this epoch. Combined with measurements of {\$}H{\_}0{\$}, one sees the pattern of deceleration followed by acceleration characteristic of a dark-energy dominated universe.},

abstract = {We present results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB. These data are consistent with the six-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and lensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9) km/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega{\_}m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar spectral index with n{\_}s = 0.968 +/- 0.006. (We quote 68{\%} errors on measured parameters and 95{\%} limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck temperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a reionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with other
astrophysical data we find N{\_} eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {\textless}0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be
{\{}$\backslash$textbar{\}}Omega{\_}K{\{}$\backslash$textbar{\}} {\textless}0.005. For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r {\textless}0.11 consistent with the B-mode constraints from an
analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r {\textless}0.09. We find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing.

abstract = {The observational status of inflation after the Planck 2013 and 2015 results and the BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck joint analysis is discussed. These pedagogical lecture notes are intended to serve as a technical guide filling the gap between the theoretical articles on inflation and the experimental works on astrophysical and cosmological data. After a short discussion of the central tenets at the basis of inflation (negative self-gravitating pressure) and its experimental verifications, it reviews how the most recent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy measurements constrain cosmic inflation. The fact that vanilla inflationary models are, so far, preferred by the observations is discussed and the reason why plateau-like potential versions of inflation are favored within this subclass of scenarios is explained. Finally, how well the future measurements, in particular of {\$}B{\$}-Mode CMB polarization or primordial gravity waves, will help to improve our knowledge about inflation is also investigated.},

@article{benson_what_2003,
abstract = {We investigate the physical mechanisms that shape the luminosity function of galaxies in hierarchical clustering models. Beginning with the mass function of dark matter halos in the $\Lambda$CDM ($\Lambda$ cold dark matter) cosmology, we show, in incremental steps, how gas cooling, photoionization at high redshift, feedback processes, galaxy merging, and thermal conduction affect the shape of the luminosity function. We consider three processes whereby supernovae and stellar wind energy can affect the forming galaxy: (1) the reheating of cold disk gas to the halo temperature; (2) expansion of the hot, diffuse halo gas; and (3) complete expulsion of cold disk gas from the halo. We demonstrate that while feedback of form 1 is able to flatten the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function, this process alone does not produce the sharp cutoff observed at large luminosities. Feedback of form 2 is also unable to solve the problem at the bright end of the luminosity function. The relative paucity of very bright galaxies can only be explained if cooling in massive halos is strongly suppressed. This might happen if thermal conduction near the centers of halos is very efficient, or if a substantial amount of gas is expelled from halos by process 3 above. Conduction is a promising mechanism, but an uncomfortably high efficiency is required to suppress cooling to the desired level. If, instead, superwinds are responsible for the lack of bright galaxies, then the total energy budget required to obtain a good match to the galaxy luminosity function greatly exceeds the energy available from supernova explosions. The mechanism is only viable if the formation of central supermassive black holes and the associated energy generation play a crucial role in limiting the amount of stars that form in the host galaxy. The models that best reproduce the galaxy luminosity function also give reasonable approximations to the Tully-Fisher relation and the galaxy autocorrelation function.},

abstract = {We describe a technique for simultaneously classifying and estimating 
the redshift of quasars. It can separate quasars from stars in arbitrary
redshift ranges, estimate full posterior distribution functions for the
redshift, and naturally incorporate flux uncertainties, missing data,
and multi-wavelength photometry. We build models of quasars in
flux-redshift space by applying the extreme deconvolution technique to
estimate the underlying density. By integrating this density over
redshift, one can obtain quasar flux densities in different redshift
ranges. This approach allows for efficient, consistent, and fast
classification and photometric redshift estimation. This is achieved by
combining the speed obtained by choosing simple analytical forms as the
basis of our density model with the flexibility of non-parametric models
through the use of many simple components with many parameters. We show
that this technique is competitive with the best photometric quasar
classification techniques—which are limited to fixed, broad
redshift ranges and high signal-to-noise ratio data—and with the
best photometric redshift techniques when applied to broadband optical
data. We demonstrate that the inclusion of UV and NIR data significantly
improves photometric quasar-star separation and essentially resolves all
of the redshift degeneracies for quasars inherent to the ugriz filter
system, even when included data have a low signal-to-noise ratio. For
quasars spectroscopically confirmed by the SDSS 84{\%} and 97{\%} of the
objects with Galaxy Evolution Explorer UV and UKIDSS NIR data have
photometric redshifts within 0.1 and 0.3, respectively, of the
spectroscopic redshift; this amounts to about a factor of three
improvement over ugriz-only photometric redshifts. Our code to calculate
quasar probabilities and redshift probability distributions is publicly
available.},

abstract = {We present high signal-to-noise measurements of the acoustic scale in the presence of nonlinear growth and redshift distortions using 320(Gpc/h){\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}3 of cosmological PM simulations. Using simple fitting methods, we obtain robust measurements of the acoustic scale with scatter close to that predicted by the Fisher matrix. We detect and quantify the shift in the acoustic scale by analyzing the power spectrum: we detect at greater than 5 sigma a decrease in the acoustic scale in the real-space matter power spectrum of 0.2{\%} at z=1.5, growing to 0.45{\%} at z=0.3. In redshift space, the shifts are about 25{\%} larger: we detect a decrease of 0.25{\%} of at z=1.5 and 0.54{\%} at z=0.3. Despite the nonzero amounts, these shifts are highly predictable numerically, and hence removable within the standard ruler analysis of clustering data. Moreover, we show that a simple density-field reconstruction method substantially reduces the scatter and nonlinear shifts of the acoustic scale measurements: the shifts are reduced to less than 0.1{\%} at z=0.3-1.5, even in the presence of non-negligible shot noise. Finally, we show that the ratio of the cosmological distance to the sound horizon that would be inferred from these fits is robust to variations in the parameterization of the fitting method and reasonable differences in the template cosmology.},

abstract = {We measure the large-scale real-space power spectrum P(k) by using a 
sample of 205,443 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, covering
2417 effective square degrees with mean redshift z{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.1. We employ a
matrix-based method using pseudo-Karhunen-Lo{\`{e}}ve eigenmodes,
producing uncorrelated minimum-variance measurements in 22 k-bands of
both the clustering power and its anisotropy due to redshift-space
distortions, with narrow and well-behaved window functions in the range
0.02hMpc-1-1. We pay particular
attention to modeling, quantifying, and correcting for potential
systematic errors, nonlinear redshift distortions, and the artificial
red-tilt caused by luminosity-dependent bias. Our results are robust to
omitting angular and radial density fluctuations and are consistent
between different parts of the sky. Our final result is a measurement of
the real-space matter power spectrum P(k) up to an unknown overall
multiplicative bias factor. Our calculations suggest that this bias
factor is independent of scale to better than a few percent for
k{\textless}0.1hMpc-1, thereby making our results useful for
precision measurements of cosmological parameters in conjunction with
data from other experiments such as the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe satellite. The power spectrum is not well-characterized by a
single power law but unambiguously shows curvature. As a simple
characterization of the data, our measurements are well fitted by a flat
scale-invariant adiabatic cosmological model with
h$\Omega$m=0.213+/-0.023 and $\sigma$8=0.89+/-0.02
for L* galaxies, when fixing the baryon fraction
$\Omega$b/$\Omega$m=0.17 and the Hubble parameter

abstract = {We present results on the clustering of 282,068 galaxies in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) sample of massive galaxies with redshifts 0.4{\textless}z{\textless}0.7 which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III project. Our results cover a large range of scales from {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.5 to {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}90 Mpc/h. We compare these estimates with the expectations of the flat LCDM cosmological model with parameters compatible with WMAP7 data. We use the MultiDark cosmological simulation together with a simple halo abundance matching technique, to estimate galaxy correlation functions, power spectra, abundance of subhaloes and galaxy biases. We find that the LCDM model gives a reasonable description to the observed correlation functions at z{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.5, which is a remarkably good agreement considering that the model, once matched to the observed abundance of BOSS galaxies, does not have any free parameters. However, we find a deviation ({\textgreater}{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}10{\%}) in the correlation functions for scales less than {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}1 Mpc/h and {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}10-40 Mpc/h. A more realistic abundance matching model and better statistics from upcoming observations are needed to clarify the situation. We also estimate that about 12{\%} of the "galaxies" in the abundance-matched sample are satellites inhabiting central haloes with mass M{\textgreater}{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}1e14 M{\_}sun/h. Using the MultiDark simulation we also study the real space halo bias b(r) of the matched catalogue finding that b=2.00+/-0.07 at large scales, consistent with the one obtained using the measured BOSS projected correlation function. Furthermore, the linear large-scale bias depends on the number density n of the abundance-matched sample as b=-0.048-(0.594+/-0.02)*log(n/(h/Mpc){\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}3). Extrapolating these results to BAO scales we measure a scale-dependent damping of the acoustic signal produced by non-linear evolution that leads to {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}2-4{\%} dips at {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}3 sigma level for wavenumbers k{\textgreater}{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.1 h/Mpc in the linear large-scale bias.},

abstract = {The discovery of cosmic acceleration has inspired ambitious experimental and observational efforts to understand its origin. Many of these take the form of large astronomical surveys, sometimes using new, special-purpose instrumentation, and in some cases entirely new facilities. This Report summarizes some of the major ongoing and planned dark energy experiments, focusing on those in which the U.S. community has a leading or significant supporting role. It provides background information for other Reports from the "Dark Energy and CMB" working group of the APS Division of Particles and Fields long-term planning exercise. We provide 1-2 page summaries of the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) and its SDSS-IV successor eBOSS, the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Subaru Hyper-Suprime Camera (HSC) and Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS), the Hobby-Eberley Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HEDTEX), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the Large Synpotic Survey Telescope (LSST), and the Euclid and AFTA-WFIRST (Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope) space missions. Over the next one to two decades, these experiments seek to improve the precision of measurements of the cosmic expansion history and cosmic structure growth by factors of 10-100, while simultaneously increasing their redshift range and tightening control and cross-checks of sytematic effects. These measurements will dramatically improve the empirical constraints on theoretical explanations of cosmic acceleration and could lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of the nature of gravity and spacetime or the forms of energy present in the universe.},

abstract = {We present a science forecast for the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) survey. Focusing on discrete tracers, we forecast the expected accuracy of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO), the redshift-space distortion (RSD) measurements, the
fNL parameter quantifying the primordial non-Gaussianity, the dark energy and modified gravity parameters. We also use the
line-of-sight clustering in the Lyman $\alpha$ forest to constrain the
total neutrino mass. We find that eBOSS luminous red galaxies, emission line galaxies and clustering quasars can achieve a precision of 1, 2.2 and 1.6 per cent, respectively, for spherically averaged BAO distance measurements. Using the same samples, the constraint on
f$\sigma$8 is expected to be 2.5, 3.3 and 2.8 per cent,
respectively. For primordial non-Gaussianity, eBOSS alone can reach an accuracy of $\sigma$(fNL) ˜ 10-15. eBOSS can at most
improve the dark energy figure of merit by a factor of 3 for the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization, and can well constrain three eigenmodes for the general equation-of-state parameter. eBOSS can also significantly improve constraints on modified gravity parameters by providing the RSD information, which is highly complementary to
constraints obtained from weak lensing measurements. A principal component analysis shows that eBOSS can measure the eigenmodes of the effective Newton's constant to 2 per cent precision; this is a factor of 10 improvement over that achievable without eBOSS. Finally, we derive the eBOSS constraint (combined with Planck, Dark Energy Survey and BOSS) on the total neutrino mass, $\sigma$($\Sigma$m$\nu$) = 0.03 eV
(68 per cent CL), which in principle makes it possible to distinguish between the two scenarios of neutrino mass hierarchies.},

@article{ross_clustering_2009,
abstract = {We present measurements of the quasar two-point correlation function, $\xi$ Q , over the redshift range 0.3 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 2.2 based
upon data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Using a homogeneous sample of 30,239 quasars with spectroscopic redshifts from the Data Release 5 Quasar Catalog, our study represents the largest sample used for this type of investigation to date. With this redshift range and an areal coverage of ≈4000 deg2, we sample over 25 h
-3 Gpc3 (comoving) of the universe in volume, assuming the current Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology.
Over this redshift range, we find that the redshift-space correlation function, $\xi$(s), is adequately fit by a single power law, with s
0 = 5.95 ± 0.45 h -1 Mpc and $\gamma$ s
= 1.16+0.11 -0.16 when fit over 1.0 h -1 Mpc {\textless}= s {\textless}= 25.0 h -1 Mpc. We find no
evidence for deviation from $\xi$(s) = 0 at scales of s{\textgreater}100 h
-1 Mpc, but do observe redshift-space distortions in the two-dimensional $\xi$(rp , $\pi$) measurement. Using the
projected correlation function, wp (rp ), we calculate the real-space correlation length, r 0 =
5.45+0.35 -0.45 h -1 Mpc and $\gamma$ = 1.90+0.04 -0.03, over scales of 1.0 h
-1 Mpc {\textless}= rp {\textless}= 130.0 h -1 Mpc. Dividing the sample into redshift slices, we find very little, if any, evidence for the evolution of quasar clustering, with the redshift-space correlation length staying roughly constant at s 0 {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 6-7 h -1 Mpc at z lsim 2.2 (and only increasing at redshifts greater than this). We do, however, see tentative evidence for evolution in the real-space correlation length, r 0, at z{\textgreater}1.7. Our results are consistent with those from the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey and previous SDSS quasar measurements using photometric redshifts. Comparing our clustering measurements to those reported for X-ray selected active galactic nucleus at z {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 0.5-1, we find reasonable agreement in some cases but significantly lower correlation lengths in others. Assuming a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we find that the linear bias evolves
from b {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 1.4 at z = 0.5 to b {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 3 at z = 2.2, with b(z = 1.27) = 2.06 ± 0.03 for the full sample. We compare our data to analytical
models and infer that quasars inhabit dark matter halos of constant mass M halo {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 2 × 1012 h -1 M
sun from redshifts z {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 2.5 (the peak of quasar activity) to z {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 0; therefore, the ratio of the halo mass for a typical quasar to the mean halo mass at the same epoch drops with decreasing redshift. The measured evolution of the clustering amplitude is in reasonable
agreement with recent theoretical models, although measurements to fainter limits will be needed to distinguish different scenarios for quasar feeding and black hole growth.},

abstract = {The third generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) took data from 2008 to 2014 using the original SDSS wide-field imager, the original and an upgraded multi-object fiber-fed optical spectrograph, a new near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph, and a novel optical interferometer. All the data from SDSS-III are now made public. In particular, this paper describes Data Release 11 (DR11) including all data acquired through 2013 July, and Data Release 12 (DR12) adding data acquired through 2014 July (including all data included in previous data releases), marking the end of SDSS-III observing. Relative to our previous public release (DR10), DR12 adds one million new spectra of galaxies and quasars from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) over an additional 3000 sq. deg of sky, more than triples the number of H-band spectra of stars as part of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and includes repeated accurate radial velocity measurements of 5500 stars from the Multi-Object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS). The APOGEE outputs now include measured abundances of 15 different elements for each star. In total, SDSS-III added 5200 sq. deg of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of the Sloan Exploration of Galactic Understanding and Evolution 2 (SEGUE-2) survey; 2,497,484 BOSS spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216 stars over 9376 sq. deg; 618,080 APOGEE spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040 MARVELS spectra of 5,513 stars. Since its first light in 1998, SDSS has imaged over 1/3 the Celestial sphere in five bands and obtained over five million astronomical spectra.},

abstract = {We have made the largest volume measurement to date of the transition to large-scale homogeneity in the distribution of galaxies. We use the WiggleZ survey, a spectroscopic survey of over 200 000 blue galaxies in a cosmic volume of ∼1 h−3 Gpc3. A new method of defining the ‘homogeneity scale' is presented, which is more robust than methods previously used in the literature, and which can be easily compared between different surveys. Due to the large cosmic depth of WiggleZ (up to z = 1), we are able to make the first measurement of the transition to homogeneity over a range of cosmic epochs. The mean number of galaxies N({\textless}r) in spheres of comoving radius r is proportional to r3 within 1 per cent, or equivalently the fractal dimension of the sample is within 1 per cent of D2 = 3, at radii larger than 71 ± 8 h−1Mpc at z ∼ 0.2, 70 ± 5 h−1 Mpc at z ∼ 0.4, 81 ± 5 h−1 Mpc at z ∼ 0.6 and 75 ± 4 h−1 Mpc at z ∼ 0.8. We demonstrate the robustness of our results against selection function effects, using a $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) N-body simulation and a suite of inhomogeneous fractal distributions. The results are in excellent agreement with both the $\Lambda$CDM N-body simulation and an analytical $\Lambda$CDM prediction. We can exclude a fractal distribution with fractal dimension below D2 = 2.97 on scales from ∼80 h−1 Mpc up to the largest scales probed by our measurement, ∼300 h−1 Mpc, at 99.99 per cent confidence.},

abstract = {We explore the requirements for a Lyman-alpha forest (LyaF) survey designed to measure the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter at 2{\~{}}{\textless}z{\~{}}{\textless}4 using the standard ruler provided by baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO). The goal would be to obtain a high enough density of sources to probe the three-dimensional density field on the scale of the BAO feature. A percent-level measurement in this redshift range can almost double the Dark Energy Task Force Figure of Merit, relative to the case with only a similar precision measurement at z{\~{}}1, if the Universe is not assumed to be flat. This improvement is greater than the one obtained by doubling the size of the z{\~{}}1 survey, with Planck and a weak SDSS-like z=0.3 BAO measurement assumed in each case. Galaxy BAO surveys at z{\~{}}1 may be able to make an effective LyaF measurement simultaneously at minimal added cost, because the required number density of quasars is relatively small. We discuss the constraining power as a function of area, magnitude limit (density of quasars), resolution, and signal-to-noise of the spectra. For example, a survey covering 2000 sq. deg. and achieving S/N=1.8 per Ang. at g=23 ({\~{}}40 quasars per sq. deg.) with an R{\~{}}{\textgreater}250 spectrograph is sufficient to measure both the radial and transverse oscillation scales to 1.4{\%} from the LyaF (or better, if fainter magnitudes and possibly Lyman-break galaxies can be used). At fixed integration time and in the sky-noise-dominated limit, a wider, noisier survey is generally more efficient; the only fundamental upper limit on noise being the need to identify a quasar and find a redshift. Because the LyaF is much closer to linear and generally better understood than galaxies, systematic errors are even less likely to be a problem.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPublished in: Phys.Rev.D76:063009,2007},

abstract = {We present a one per cent measurement of the cosmic distance scale from the detections of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of galaxies from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. Our results come from the Data Release 11 (DR11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and covering approximately 8500 square degrees and the redshift range 0.2 {\textless}zz {\textless}0.7. We also compare these results with those from the publicly released DR9 and DR10 samples. Assuming a concordance $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model, the DR11 sample covers a volume of 13 Gpc3 and is the largest region of the Universe ever surveyed at this density. We measure the correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the BAO feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of over 7$\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance relative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, rd, which has a value of rd,fid = 149.28 Mpc in our fiducial cosmology. We find DV = (1264 ± 25 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at zz = 0.32 and DV = (2056 ± 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at zz = 0.57. At 1.0 per cent, this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. Separating the clustering along and transverse to the line of sight yields measurements at zz = 0.57 of DA = (1421 ± 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) and H = (96.8 ± 3.4 km s−1 Mpc−1)(rd,fid/rd). Our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement with previous BAO measurements and with the predictions from cosmic microwave background data for a spatially flat CDM model with a cosmological constant.},

abstract = {Observations of redshift-space distortions in spectroscopic galaxy surveys offer an attractive method for observing the build-up of cosmological structure. In this paper, we develop and test a new statistic based on anisotropies in the measured galaxy power spectrum, which is independent of galaxy bias and matches the matter power spectrum shape on large scales. The amplitude provides a constraint on the derivative of the linear growth rate through f$\sigma$8(mass). This demonstrates that spectroscopic galaxy surveys offer many of the same advantages as weak lensing surveys, in that they both use galaxies as test particles to probe all matter in the Universe. They are complementary as redshift-space distortions probe non-relativistic velocities and therefore the temporal metric perturbations, while weak lensing tests the sum of the temporal and spatial metric perturbations. The degree to which our estimator can be pushed into the non-linear regime is considered and we show that a simple Gaussian damping model, similar to that previously used to model the behaviour of the power spectrum on very small scales, can also model the quasi-linear behaviour of our estimator. This enhances the information that can be extracted from surveys for $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) models.},

abstract = {We investigate the effect of primordial non-Gaussianity of the local fNL type on the auto- and cross-power spectra of dark matter haloes using simulations of the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmology. We perform a series of large N-body simulations of both positive and negative fNL, spanning the range between 10 and 100. Theoretical models predict a scale-dependent bias correction $\Delta$b(k, fNL) that depends on the linear halo bias b(M). We measure the power spectra for a range of halo mass and redshifts covering the relevant range of existing galaxy and quasar populations. We show that auto- and cross-correlation analyses of bias are consistent with each other. We find that for low wavenumbers with k {\textless}0.03 h Mpc−1 the theory and the simulations agree well with each other for biased haloes with b(M) {\textgreater}1.5. We show that a scale-independent bias correction improves the comparison between theory and simulations on smaller scales, where the scale-dependent effect rapidly becomes negligible. The current limits on fNL from Slosar et al. come mostly from very large scales k {\textless}0.01 h Mpc−1 and, therefore, remain valid. For the halo samples with b(M) {\textless}1.5 − 2, we find that the scale-dependent bias from non-Gaussianity actually exceeds the theoretical predictions. Our results are consistent with the bias correction scaling linearly with fNL.},

abstract = {The use of a lognormal (LN) random field, non-Gaussian random field as a model for the distribution of matter in the universe is discussed. As the general LN field includes the Gaussian case in the limit of zero rms fluctuation it is possible to perform a statistical decomposition. The statistical properties of the model can be formulated in terms of one covariance function. Difficulties with the statistical treatment of density perturbations such as the fact that the LN model is not
completely specified by its moments have been revealed by analysis of the model. It is shown that for discriminating between Gaussian and non-Gaussian fluctuations the method of representing the three- and four-point correlation functions of galaxies in terms of the parameters Q and R is not useful. Parameterizations in terms of the skewness and kurtosis are proposed.},

The instrument will be used to carry out photometry essentially simultaneously in five color bands spanning the range accessible to silicon detectors on the ground in the time-delay- and-integrate (TDI) scanning mode. The photometric detectors are arrayed in the focal plane in six columns of five chips each such that two scans cover a filled stripe 2.5 degrees wide.

@article{bagla_fractal_2008,
abstract = {Homogeneity and isotropy of the universe at sufficiently large scales is a fundamental premise on which modern cosmology is based. Fractal dimensions of matter distribution are a parameter that can be used to test the hypothesis of homogeneity. In this method, galaxies are used as tracers of the distribution of matter and samples derived from various galaxy redshift surveys have been used to determine the scale of homogeneity in the Universe. Ideally, for homogeneity, the distribution should be a monofractal with the fractal dimension equal to the ambient dimension. While this ideal definition is true for infinitely large point sets, this may not be realized as in practice, we have only a finite point set. The correct benchmark for realistic data sets is a homogeneous distribution of a finite number of points and this should be used in place of the mathematically defined fractal dimension for infinite number of points (D) as a requirement for approach towards homogeneity. We derive the expected fractal dimension for a homogeneous distribution of a finite number of points. We show that for sufficiently large data sets the expected fractal dimension approaches D in absence of clustering. It is also important to take the weak, but non-zero amplitude of clustering at very large scales into account. In this paper we also compute the expected fractal dimension for a finite point set that is weakly clustered. Clustering introduces departures in the fractal dimensions from D and in most situations the departures are small if the amplitude of clustering is small. Features in the two-point correlation function, like those introduced by baryon acoustic oscillations can lead to non-trivial variations in the fractal dimensions where the amplitude of clustering and deviations from D are no longer related in a monotonic manner. We show that in the concordance model, the fractal dimension makes a rapid transition to values close to 3 at scales between 40 and 100 Mpc.},

a multifractal scaling at {\textless}30 h-1 Mpc. From the scaling
exponent, we obtain the generalized dimension, which decreases from 2

lie, around voids, in planar structures with filamentary dense regions.

@article{gallazzi_census_2008,
abstract = {We combine stellar metallicity and stellar mass estimates for a large sample of galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 2 (SDSS DR2) spanning wide ranges in physical properties, in order to derive an inventory of the total mass of metals and baryons locked up in stars in the local Universe. Physical parameter estimates are derived from galaxy spectra with high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) (of at least 20). Co-added spectra of galaxies with similar velocity dispersions, absolute r-band magnitudes and 4000-{\AA} break values are used for those regions of parameter space where individual spectra have lower S/N. We estimate the total density of metals $\rho$Z and of baryons $\rho$* in stars and, from these two quantities, we obtain a mass- and volume-averaged stellar metallicity of {\textless}Z*{\textgreater}= 1.04 +/- 0.14Zsolar, i.e. consistent with solar. We also study how metals are distributed in galaxies according to different properties, such as mass, morphology, mass- and light-weighted age, and we then compare these distributions with the corresponding distributions of stellar mass. We find that the bulk of metals locked up in stars in the local Universe reside in massive, bulge-dominated galaxies, with red colours and high 4000-{\AA} break values corresponding to old stellar populations. Bulge-dominated and disc-dominated galaxies contribute similar amounts to the total stellar mass density, but have different fractional contributions to the mass density of metals in stars, in agreement with the mass-metallicity relation. Bulge-dominated galaxies contain roughly 40 per cent of the total amount of metals in stars, while disc-dominated galaxies less than 25 per cent. Finally, at a given galaxy stellar mass, we define two characteristic ages as the median of the distributions of mass and metals as a function of age. These characteristic ages decrease progressively from high-mass to low-mass galaxies, consistent with the high formation epochs of stars in massive galaxies.},

The cross-correlation is detected over a wide range of scales, up to comoving separations r of 80 h−1Mpc. For r {\textgreater}15 h−1Mpc, we show that the cross-correlation is well fitted by the linear theory prediction for the mean overdensity around a quasar host halo in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, with the redshift distortions indicative of gravitational evolution detected at high confidence. Using previous determinations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest bias factor obtained from the Ly$\alpha$ autocorrelation, we infer the quasar bias factor to be bq = 3.64+0.13−0.15 at a mean redshift z = 2.38, in agreement with previous measurements from the quasar auto-correlation. We also obtain a new estimate of the Ly$\alpha$ forest redshift distortion factor, $\beta$F = 1.1±0.15, slightly larger than but consistent with the previous measurement from the Ly$\alpha$ forest autocorrelation. The simple linear model we use fails at separations r {\textless}15h−1Mpc, and we show that this may reasonably be due to the enhanced ionization due to radiation from the quasars. We also provide the expected correction that the mass overdensity around the quasar implies for measurements of the ionizing radiation background from the line-of-sight proximity effect.},

We find that the statistical properties of our sample are in excellent agreement with the standard cosmological model, and that it reaches the homogeneous regime significantly faster than a class of fractal models with dimensions {\$}D{\textless}2.75{\$}. As part of our search for systematic effects, we also study the presence of hemispherical asymmetries in our data, finding no significant deviation beyond those allowed by the concordance model.},

abstract = {We present an improved prescription for matter power spectrum in redshift space taking a proper account of both the non-linear gravitational clustering and redshift distortion, which are of particular importance for accurately modeling baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). Contrary to the models of redshift distortion phenomenologically introduced but frequently used in the literature, the new model includes the corrections arising from the non-linear coupling between the density and velocity fields associated with two competitive effects of redshift distortion, i.e., Kaiser and Finger-of-God effects. Based on the improved treatment of perturbation theory for gravitational clustering, we compare our model predictions with monopole and quadrupole power spectra of N-body simulations, and an excellent agreement is achieved over the scales of BAOs. Potential impacts on constraining dark energy and modified gravity from the redshift-space power spectrum are also investigated based on the Fisher-matrix formalism. We find that the existing phenomenological models of redshift distortion produce a systematic error on measurements of the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter by 1{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}2{\%}, and the growth rate parameter by {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}5{\%}, which would become non-negligible for future galaxy surveys. Correctly modeling redshift distortion is thus essential, and the new prescription of redshift-space power spectrum including the non-linear corrections can be used as an accurate theoretical template for anisotropic BAOs.},

abstract = {We simulate the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes by implementing a suite of semi-analytic models on the output of the Millennium Run, a very large simulation of the concordance $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmogony. Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.},

abstract = {The Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will conduct novel cosmological observations using the BOSS spectrograph at Apache Point Observatory. Observations will be simultaneous with the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) designed for variability studies and the Spectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) program designed for studies of X-ray sources. eBOSS will use four different tracers to measure the distance-redshift relation with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). Using more than 250,000 new, spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies at a median redshift z=0.72, we project that eBOSS will yield measurements of {\$}d{\_}A(z){\$} to an accuracy of 1.2{\%} and measurements of H(z) to 2.1{\%} when combined with the z{\textgreater}0.6 sample of BOSS galaxies. With {\~{}}195,000 new emission line galaxy redshifts, we expect BAO measurements of {\$}d{\_}A(z){\$} to an accuracy of 3.1{\%} and H(z) to 4.7{\%} at an effective redshift of z= 0.87. A sample of more than 500,000 spectroscopically-confirmed quasars will provide the first BAO distance measurements over the redshift range 0.9{\textless}z{\textless}2.2, with expected precision of 2.8{\%} and 4.2{\%} on {\$}d{\_}A(z){\$} and H(z), respectively. Finally, with 60,000 new quasars and re-observation of 60,000 quasars known from BOSS, we will obtain new Lyman-alpha forest measurements at redshifts z{\textgreater}2.1; these new data will enhance the precision of {\$}d{\_}A(z){\$} and H(z) by a factor of 1.44 relative to BOSS. Furthermore, eBOSS will provide improved tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales through redshift-space distortion measurements, improved tests for non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field, and new constraints on the summed mass of all neutrino species. Here, we provide an overview of the cosmological goals, spectroscopic target sample, demonstration of spectral quality from early data, and projected cosmological constraints from eBOSS.},

@article{kaviraj_uv_2007,
abstract = {We present the first large-scale study of E+A galaxies that incorporates photometry in the ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. E+A galaxies are `post-starburst' systems, with strong Balmer absorption lines indicating significant recent star formation, but without [OII] and H$\alpha$ emission lines which are characteristic of ongoing star formation. The starburst that creates the E+A galaxy typically takes place within the last Gyr and creates a high fraction (20-60 per cent) of the stellar mass in the remnant over a short time-scale ({\textless}0.1 Gyr). We find a tight correlation between the luminosity of our E+A galaxies and the implied star formation rate (SFR) during the starburst. While low-luminosity E+As [M(z) {\textgreater}-20] exhibit implied SFRs of less than 50Msolaryr-1, their luminous counterparts [M(z) {\textless}-22] show SFRs greater than 300 and as high as 2000Msolaryr-1, suggesting that luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies in the low-redshift Universe could be the progenitors of massive nearby E+A galaxies. We perform a comprehensive study of the characteristics of the quenching that truncates the starburst in E+A systems. We find that, for galaxies less massive than 1010Msolar, the quenching efficiency decreases as the galaxy mass increases. However, for galaxies more massive than 1010Msolar, this trend is reversed and the quenching efficiency increases with galaxy mass. Noting that the mass threshold at which this reversal occurs is in excellent agreement with the mass above which active galactic nuclei (AGN) become significantly more abundant in nearby galaxies, we use simple energetic arguments to show that the bimodal behaviour of the quenching efficiency is consistent with AGN and supernovae (SN) being the principal sources of negative feedback above and below M 1010Msolar, respectively. The arguments assume that quenching occurs through the mechanical ejection or dispersal of the gas reservoir and that, in the high-mass regime (M {\textgreater}1010Msolar), the Eddington ratios in this sample of galaxies scale as M$\gamma$, where 1 {\textless}$\gamma$ {\textless}3. Finally, we use our E+A sample to estimate the time it takes for galaxies to migrate from the blue cloud to the red sequence. We find migration times between 1 and 5 Gyr, with a median value of 1.5 Gyr.},

excellent image quality and small geometric distortions over a wide wavelength range (3000-10,600 {\AA}) in the imaging mode, and good
image quality combined with very small lateral and longitudinal color errors in the spectroscopic mode. The unusual requirement of very low distortion is set by the demands of time-delay-and-integrate (TDI) imaging. (2) Very high precision motion to support open-loop TDI observations.

abstract = {We describe a method from which cosmology may be constrained from the 2QZ Survey. By comparing clustering properties parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight and by modeling the effects of redshift space distortions, we are able to study geometric distortions in the clustering pattern which occur if a wrong cosmology is assumed when translating redshifts into comoving distances. Using mock 2QZ catalogues, drawn from the Hubble Volume simulation, we find, that there is a degeneracy between the geometric and the redshift-space distortions that makes it difficult to obtain an unambiguous estimate of Omega{\_}{\{}m{\}}(0) from the geometric tests alone. However, we demonstrate a new method to determine the cosmology which works by combining the above geometric test with a test based on the evolution of the QSO clustering amplitude. We find that we are able to break the degeneracy and that independent constraints to +-20{\%} (1 sigma) accuracy on Omega{\_}{\{}m{\}}(0) and +-10{\%} (1 sigma) accuracy on beta{\_}{\{}QSO{\}}(z) should be possible in the full 2QZ survey. Finally we apply the method to the 10k catalogue of 2QZ QSOs. The smaller number of QSOs and the current status of the Survey mean that a strong result on cosmology is not possible but we do constrain beta{\_}{\{}QSO{\}}(z) to 0.35+-0.2. By combining this constraint with the further constraint available from the amplitude of QSO clustering, we find tentative evidence favouring a model with non-zero Omega{\_}{\{}Lambda{\}}(0), although an Omega{\_}{\{}m{\}}(0)=1 model provides only a marginally less good fit. A model with Omega{\_}{\{}Lambda{\}}(0)=1 is ruled out. The results are in agreement with those found by Outram et al. using a similar analysis in Fourier space. (Abridged)},

abstract = {We present a study of the effect of High Column Density (HCD) systems on the Lyman $\backslash$alpha forest correlation function on large scales. We study the effect both numerically, by inserting HCD systems on mock spectra for a specific model, and analytically, in the context of two-point correlations and linear theory. We show that the presence of HCDs substantially contributes to the noise of the correlation function measurement, and systematically alters the measured redshift-space correlation function of the Lyman $\backslash$alpha forest, increasing the value of the density bias factor and decreasing the redshift distortion parameter {\$}\backslashbeta{\_}\backslashalpha{\$} of the Lyman $\backslash$alpha forest. We provide simple formulae for corrections on these derived parameters, as a function of the mean effective optical depth and bias factor of the host halos of the HCDs, and discuss the conditions under which these expressions should be valid. In practice, precise corrections to the measured parameters of the Lyman $\backslash$alpha forest correlation for the HCD effects are more complex than the simple analytical approximations we present, owing to non-linear effects of the damped wings of the HCD systems and the presence of three-point terms. However, we conclude that an accurate correction for these HCD effects can be obtained numerically and calibrated with observations of the HCD-Lyman $\backslash$alpha cross-correlation. We also discuss an analogous formalism to treat and correct for the contaminating effect of metal lines overlapping the Lyman $\backslash$alpha forest spectra.},

Galaxy redshift surveys currently in progress will, on completion, allow us to measure the quadrupole distortion in the 2-point correlation function, xi(sigma, pi), or its Fourier
transform, the power spectrum P(k, mu), to a high degree of accuracy. On these scales we typically find a positive quadrupole, as expected for coherent infall on to overdense regions and outflow from underdense regions, but the distortion is substantially weaker than that predicted by pure linear theory. We assess two models that may be regarded as refinements to linear theory, the Zel'dovich approximation and a dispersion model in which the non-linear velocities generated by the formation of virialized groups and clusters are treated as random perturbations to the velocities predicted by linear theory. We find that neither provides an adequate physical description of the clustering pattern. If used to model redshift-space distortions on scales for 10},

abstract = {Statistical analyses of finite sample distributions usually assume that fluctuations are self-averaging, i.e. that they are statistically similar in different regions of the given sample volume. By using the scale-length method, we test whether this assumption is satisfied in several samples of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Six. We find that the probability density function (PDF) of conditional fluctuations, filtered on large enough spatial scales (i.e., r{\textgreater}30 Mpc/h), shows relevant systematic variations in different sub-volumes of the survey. Instead for scales r{\textless}30 Mpc/h the PDF is statistically stable, and its first moment presents scaling behavior with a negative exponent around one. Thus while up to 30 Mpc/h galaxy structures have well-defined power-law correlations, on larger scales it is not possible to consider whole sample average quantities as meaningful and useful statistical descriptors. This situation is due to the fact that galaxy structures correspond to density fluctuations which are too large in amplitude and too extended in space to be self-averaging on such large scales inside the sample volumes: galaxy distribution is inhomogeneous up to the largest scales, i.e. r {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 100 Mpc/h, probed by the SDSS samples. We show that cosmological corrections, as K-corrections and standard evolutionary corrections, do not qualitatively change the relevant behaviors. Finally we show that the large amplitude galaxy fluctuations observed in the SDSS samples are at odds with the predictions of the standard LCDM model of structure formation.(Abridged version).},

abstract = {We describe mock data-sets generated to simulate the high-redshift 
quasar sample in Data Release 11 (DR11) of the SDSS-III Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). The mock spectra contain
Ly$\alpha$ forest correlations useful for studying the 3D correlation
function including Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). They also include
astrophysical effects such as quasar continuum diversity and
high-density absorbers, instrumental effects such as noise and spectral
resolution, as well as imperfections introduced by the SDSS pipeline
treatment of the raw data. The Ly$\alpha$ forest BAO analysis of the BOSS
collaboration, described in Delubac et al. 2014, has used these mock
data-sets to develop and cross-check analysis procedures prior to
performing the BAO analysis on real data, and for continued systematic
cross checks. Tests presented here show that the simulations reproduce
sufficiently well important characteristics of real spectra. These mock
data-sets will be made available together with the data at the time of
the Data Release 11.},

abstract = {The Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will conduct novel cosmological observations using the BOSS spectrograph at Apache Point Observatory. Observations will be simultaneous with the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) designed for variability studies and the Spectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) program designed for studies of X-ray sources. eBOSS will use four different tracers to measure the distance-redshift relation with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). Using more than 250,000 new, spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies at a median redshift z=0.72, we project that eBOSS will yield measurements of {\$}d{\_}A(z){\$} to an accuracy of 1.2{\%} and measurements of H(z) to 2.1{\%} when combined with the z{\textgreater}0.6 sample of BOSS galaxies. With {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}195,000 new emission line galaxy redshifts, we expect BAO measurements of {\$}d{\_}A(z){\$} to an accuracy of 3.1{\%} and H(z) to 4.7{\%} at an effective redshift of z= 0.87. A sample of more than 500,000 spectroscopically-confirmed quasars will provide the first BAO distance measurements over the redshift range 0.9{\textless}z{\textless}2.2, with expected precision of 2.8{\%} and 4.2{\%} on {\$}d{\_}A(z){\$} and H(z), respectively. Finally, with 60,000 new quasars and re-observation of 60,000 quasars known from BOSS, we will obtain new Lyman-alpha forest measurements at redshifts z{\textgreater}2.1; these new data will enhance the precision of {\$}d{\_}A(z){\$} and H(z) by a factor of 1.44 relative to BOSS. Furthermore, eBOSS will provide improved tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales through redshift-space distortion measurements, improved tests for non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field, and new constraints on the summed mass of all neutrino species. Here, we provide an overview of the cosmological goals, spectroscopic target sample, demonstration of spectral quality from early data, and projected cosmological constraints from eBOSS.},

abstract = {We perform the first fit to the anisotropic clustering of Sloan Digital Sky Survey III CMASS data release 10 galaxies on scales of ∼0.8–32 h−1 Mpc. A standard halo occupation distribution model evaluated near the best-fitting Planck $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology provides a good fit to the observed anisotropic clustering, and implies a normalization for the peculiar velocity field of M ∼ 2 × 1013h−1 M⊙ haloes of f$\sigma$8(z = 0.57) = 0.450 ± 0.011. Since this constraint includes both quasi-linear and non-linear scales, it should severely constrain modified gravity models that enhance pairwise infall velocities on these scales. Though model dependent, our measurement represents a factor of 2.5 improvement in precision over the analysis of DR11 on large scales, f$\sigma$8(z = 0.57) = 0.447 ± 0.028, and is the tightest single constraint on the growth rate of cosmic structure to date. Our measurement is consistent with the Planck $\Lambda$CDM prediction of 0.480 ± 0.010 at the ∼1.9$\sigma$ level. Assuming a halo mass function evaluated at the best-fitting Planck cosmology, we also find that 10 per cent of CMASS galaxies are satellites in haloes of mass M ∼ 6 × 1013 h−1 M⊙. While none of our tests and model generalizations indicate systematic errors due to an insufficiently detailed model of the galaxy–halo connection, the precision of these first results warrant further investigation into the modelling uncertainties and degeneracies with cosmological parameters.},

extrapolated down as a power law ($\gamma$=1.53) to the separations

abstract = {One of the main problems of observational cosmology is to determine the range in which a reliable measurement of galaxy correlations is possible. This corresponds to determine the shape of the correlation function, its possible evolution with redshift and the size and amplitude of large scale structures. Different selection effects, inevitably entering in any observation, introduce important constraints in the measurement of correlations. In the context of galaxy redshift surveys selection effects can be caused by observational techniques and strategies and by implicit assumptions used in the data analysis. Generally all these effects are taken into account by using pair-counting algorithms to measure two-point correlations. We review these methods stressing that they are based on the a-priori assumption that galaxy distribution is spatially homogeneous inside a given sample. We show that, when this assumption is not satisfied by the data, results of the correlation analysis are affected by finite size effects.In order to quantify these effects, we introduce a new method based on the computation of the gradient of galaxy counts along tiny cylinders. We show, by using artificial homogeneous and inhomogeneous point distributions, that this method is to identify redshift dependent selection effects and to disentangle them from the presence of large scale density fluctuations. We then apply this new method to several redshift catalogs and we find evidences that galaxy distribution, in those samples where selection effects are small enough, is characterized by power-law correlations with exponent $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}gamma=0.9{\$} up to {\$}20{\$} Mpc/h followed by a change of slope that, in the range [20,100] Mpc/h, corresponds to a power-law exponent $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}gamma=0.25{\$}. Whether a crossover to spatial unformity occurs at $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}sim 100{\$} Mpc/h cannot be clarified by the present data.},

@article{granato_physical_2004,
abstract = {We present a physically motivated model for the early coevolution of massive spheroidal galaxies and active nuclei at their centers. Within dark matter halos, forming at the rate predicted by the canonical hierarchical clustering scenario, the gas evolution is controlled by gravity, radiative cooling, and heating by feedback from supernovae and from the growing active nucleus. Supernova heating is increasingly effective with decreasing binding energy in slowing down the star formation and in driving gas outflows. The more massive protogalaxies virializing at earlier times are thus the sites of the faster star formation. The correspondingly higher radiation drag fastens the angular momentum loss by the gas, resulting in a larger accretion rate onto the central black hole. In turn, the kinetic energy carried by outflows driven by active nuclei can unbind the residual gas, thus halting both the star formation and the black hole growth, in a time again shorter for larger halos. For the most massive galaxies the gas unbinding time is short enough for the bulk of the star formation to be completed before Type Ia supernovae can substantially increase the Fe abundance of the interstellar medium, thus accounting for the $\alpha$-enhancement seen in the largest galaxies. The feedback from supernovae and from the active nucleus also determines the relationship between the black hole mass and the mass, or the velocity dispersion, of the host galaxy, as well as the black hole mass function. In both cases the model predictions are in excellent agreement with the observational data. Coupling the model with GRASIL (Silva et al. 1998), the code computing in a self-consistent way the chemical and spectrophotometric evolution of galaxies over a very wide wavelength interval, we have obtained predictions in excellent agreement with observations for a number of observables that proved to be extremely challenging for all the current semianalytic models, including the submillimeter counts and the corresponding redshift distributions, and the epoch-dependent K-band luminosity function of spheroidal galaxies.},

@article{fisher_validity_1995,
abstract = {The relation between the galaxy correlation functions in real-space and 
redshift-space is derived in the linear regime by an appropriate
averaging of the joint probability distribution of density and velocity.
The derivation recovers the familiar linear theory result on large
scales but has the advantage of clearly revealing the dependence of the
redshift distortions on the underlying peculiar velocity field;
streaming motions give rise to distortions of
$\theta$($\Omega$0.6/b) while variations in the anisotropic
velocity dispersion yield terms of order
$\theta$($\Omega$1.2/b2). This probabilistic
derivation of the redshift-space correlation function is similar in
spirit to the derivation of the commonly used "streaming" model, in
which the distortions are given by a convolution of the real-space
correlation function with a velocity distribution function. The
streaming model is often used to model the redshift-space correlation
function on small, highly nonlinear, scales. There have been claims in
the literature, however, that the streaming model is not valid in the
linear regime. Our analysis confirms this claim, but we show that the
streaming model can be made consistent with linear theory provided that
the model for the streaming has the functional form predicted by linear
theory and that the velocity distribution is chosen to be a Gaussian
with the correct linear theory dispersion.},

abstract = {We study the first year of the eBOSS quasar sample in the redshift range {\$}0.9{\textless}z{\textless}2.2{\$} which includes 68,772 homogeneously selected quasars. We show that the main source of systematics in the evaluation of the correlation function arises from inhomogeneities in the quasar target selection, particularly related to the extinction and depth of the imaging data used for targeting. We propose a weighting scheme that mitigates these systematics. We measure the quasar correlation function and provide the most accurate measurement to date of the quasar bias in this redshift range, {\$}b{\_}Q = 2.45 \backslashpm 0.05{\$} at {\$}\backslashbar z=1.55{\$}, together with its evolution with redshift. We use this information to determine the minimum mass of the halo hosting the quasars and the characteristic halo mass, which we find to be both independent of redshift within statistical error. Using a recently-measured quasar-luminosity-function we also determine the quasar duty cycle. The size of this first year sample is insufficient to detect any luminosity dependence to quasar clustering and this issue should be further studied with the final {\$}\backslashsim{\$}500,000 eBOSS quasar sample.},

abstract = {Using a sample of approximately 14,000 z{\textgreater}2.1 quasars observed in the first year of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), we measure the three-dimensional correlation function of absorption in the Lyman-alpha forest. The angle-averaged correlation function of transmitted flux (F = exp(-tau)) is securely detected out to comoving separations of 60 Mpc/h, the first detection of flux correlations across widely separated sightlines. A quadrupole distortion of the redshift-space correlation function by peculiar velocities, the signature of the gravitational instability origin of structure in the Lyman-alpha forest, is also detected at high significance. We obtain a good fit to the data assuming linear theory redshift-space distortion and linear bias of the transmitted flux, relative to the matter fluctuations of a standard LCDM cosmological model (inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological constant). At 95{\%} confidence, we find a linear bias parameter 0.16{\textless}b{\textless}0.24 and redshift-distortion parameter 0.44{\textless}beta{\textless}1.20, at central redshift z=2.25, with a well constrained combination b(1+$\backslash$beta)=0.336 +/- 0.012. The errors on beta are asymmetric, with beta=0 excluded at over 5 sigma confidence level. The value of beta is somewhat low compared to theoretical predictions, and our tests on synthetic data suggest that it is depressed (relative to expectations for the Lyman-alpha forest alone) by the presence of high column density systems and metal line absorption. These results set the stage for cosmological parameter determinations from three-dimensional structure in the Lyman-alpha forest, including anticipated constraints on dark energy from baryon acoustic oscillations.},

@article{taylor_putting_2012,
abstract = {Cosmological parameter estimation requires that the likelihood function of the data is accurately known. Assuming that cosmological large-scale structure power spectra data are multivariate Gaussian-distributed, we show the accuracy of parameter estimation is limited by the accuracy of the inverse data covariance matrix - the precision matrix. If the data covariance and precision matrices are estimated by sampling independent realisations of the data, their statistical properties are described by the Wishart and Inverse-Wishart distributions, respectively. Independent of any details of the survey, we show that the fractional error on a parameter variance, or a Figure-of-Merit, is equal to the fractional variance of the precision matrix. In addition, for the only unbiased estimator of the precision matrix, we find that the fractional accuracy of the parameter error depends only on the difference between the number of independent realisations and the number of data points, and so can easily diverge. For a 5{\%} error on a parameter error and N{\_}D {\textless}{\textless}100 data-points, a minimum of 200 realisations of the survey are needed, with 10{\%} accuracy for the data covariance. If the number of data-points N{\_}D {\textgreater}{\textgreater}100 we need N{\_}S {\textgreater}N{\_}D realisations and a fractional accuracy of {\textless}sqrt[2/N{\_}D] in the data covariance. As the number of power spectra data points grows to N{\_}D{\textgreater}10{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}4 -10{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}6 this approach will be problematic. We discuss possible ways to relax these conditions: improved theoretical modelling; shrinkage methods; data-compression; simulation and data resampling methods.},

abstract = {We use recent observations of the evolution of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rate with redshift, the dependence of the SN Ia rate on the colours of the parent galaxies, and the enhancement of the SN Ia rate in radio-loud early-type galaxies to derive on robust empirical grounds, the delay time distribution (DTD) between the formation of the progenitor star and its explosion as an SN. Our analysis finds: (i) delay times as long as 3-4 Gyr, derived from observations of SNe Ia at high redshift, cannot reproduce the dependence of the SN Ia rate on the colours and on the radio-luminosity of the parent galaxies, as observed in the local Universe; (ii) the comparison between observed SN rates and a grid of theoretical `single-population' DTDs shows that only a few of them are possibly consistent with observations. The most successful models are all predicting a peak of SN explosions soon after star formation and an extended tail in the DTD, and can reproduce the data but only at a modest statistical confidence level; (iii) present data are best matched by a bimodal DTD, in which about 50 per cent of SNe Ia (dubbed `prompt' SNe Ia) explode soon after their stellar birth, in a time of the order of 108 yr, while the remaining 50 per cent (`tardy' SNe Ia) have a much wider distribution, well described by an exponential function with a decay time of about 3 Gyr. The presence in the DTD of both a strong peak at early times and a prolonged exponential tail, coupled with the well-established bimodal distribution of the decay rate ($\Delta$m15) and the systematic difference observed in the expansion velocities of the ejecta of SNe Ia in ellipticals and spirals, suggests the existence of two classes of progenitors. We discuss the cosmological implications of this result and make simple predictions, which are testable with future instrumentation.},

abstract = {On large scales a nonlinear transformation of matter density field can be viewed as a biased tracer of the density field itself. A nonlinear transformation also modifies the redshift space distortions in the same limit, giving rise to a velocity bias. In models with primordial nongaussianity a nonlinear transformation generates a scale dependent bias on large scales. We derive analytic expressions for these for a general nonlinear transformation. These biases can be expressed entirely in terms of the one point distribution function (PDF) of the final field and the parameters of the transformation. Our analysis allows one to devise nonlinear transformations with nearly arbitrary bias properties, which can be used to increase the signal in the large scale clustering limit. We apply the results to the ionizing equilibrium model of Lyman-alpha forest, in which Lyman-alpha flux F is related to the density perturbation delta via a nonlinear transformation. Velocity bias can be expressed as an average over the Lyman-alpha flux PDF. At z=2.4 we predict the velocity bias of -0.1, compared to the observed value of -0.13 +/- 0.03. Bias and primordial nongaussianity bias depend on the parameters of the transformation. Measurements of bias can thus be used to constrain these parameters, and for reasonable values of the ionizing background intensity we can match the predictions to observations. Matching to the observed values we predict the ratio of primordial nongaussianity bias to bias to have the opposite sign and lower magnitude than the corresponding values for the highly biased galaxies, but this depends on the model parameters and can also vanish or change the sign.},

abstract = {We present 279 galaxy cluster candidates at z {\textgreater} 1.3 selected from the 94 deg 2 Spitzer South Pole Telescope Deep Field (SSDF) survey. We use a simple algorithm to select candidate high-redshift clusters of galaxies based on Spitzer/IRAC mid-infrared data combined with shallow all-sky optical data. We identify distant cluster candidates in SSDF adopting an overdensity threshold that results in a high purity (80{\%}) cluster sample based on tests in the Spitzer Deep, Wide-Field Survey of the Bo{\"{o}}tes field. Our simple algorithm detects all three 1.4 {\textless} z ≤ 1.75 X-ray detected clusters in the Bo{\"{o}}tes field. The uniqueness of the SSDF survey resides not just in its area, one of the largest contiguous extragalactic fields observed with Spitzer, but also in its deep, multi-wavelength coverage by the South Pole Telescope (SPT), Herschel/SPIRE and XMM-Newton. This rich dataset will allow direct or stacked measurements of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect decrements or X-ray masses for many of the SSDF clusters presented here, and enable systematic study of the most distant clusters on an unprecedented scale. We measure the angular correlation function of our sample and find that these candidates show strong clustering. Employing the COSMOS/UltraVista photometric catalog in order to infer the redshift distribution of our cluster selection, we find that these clusters have a comoving number density n c = (0.7 +6.3},

abstract = {In order to investigate whether galaxy structures are compatible with the predictions of the standard LCDM cosmology, we focus here on the analysis of several simple and basic statistical properties of the galaxy density field. Namely, we test whether, on large enough scales (i.e., r{\textgreater}10 Mpc/h), this is self-averaging, uniform and characterized by a Gaussian probability density function of fluctuations. These are three different and clear predictions of the LCDM cosmology which are fulfilled in mock galaxy catalogs generated from cosmological N-body simulations representing this model. We consider some simple statistical measurements able to tests these properties in a finite sample. We discuss that the analysis of several samples of the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey show that galaxy structures are non self-averaging and inhomogeneous on scales of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}100 Mpc/h, and are thus intrinsically different from LCDM model predictions. Correspondingly the probability density function of fluctuations shows a "fat tail" and it is thus different from the Gaussian prediction. Finally we discuss other recent observations which are odds with LCDM predictions and which are, at least theoretically, compatible with the highly inhomogeneous nature of galaxy distribution. We point out that inhomogeneous structures can be fully compatible with statistical isotropy and homogeneity, and thus with a relaxed version of the Cosmological Principle.},

Massive spectroscopic surveys of high-redshift quasars yield large numbers of correlated Ly$\alpha$ absorption spectra that can be used to measure large-scale structure. Simu-lations of these surveys are required to accurately interpret the measurements of correlations and correct for systematic errors. An efficient method to generate mock realizations of Ly$\alpha$ forest surveys is presented which generates a field over the lines of sight to the survey sources only, instead of having to generate it over the entire three-dimensional volume of the survey. The method can be calibrated to reproduce the power spectrum and one-point distribution function of the transmitted flux fraction, as well as the redshift evolution of these quantities, and is easily used for modeling any survey systematic effects. We present an example of how these mock surveys are applied to predict the measurement errors in a survey with similar parameters as the BOSS quasar survey in SDSS-III.},

abstract = {We characterize galaxy correlations in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey by measuring several moments of galaxy counts in spheres. We firstly find that the average counts grows as a power-law function of the distance with an exponent D=2.1±0.05 for r[0.5, 20] Mpc/h and D=2.8±0.05 for r[30, 150] Mpc/h. In order to estimate the systematic errors in these measurements we consider the counts variance finding that it shows systematic finite-size effects which depend on the samples sizes. We clarify, by making specific tests, that these are due to the galaxy long-range correlations extending up to the largest scales of the sample. The analysis of mock galaxy catalogs, generated from cosmological N-body simulations of the standard LCDM model, shows that for r{\textless}20 Mpc/h the counts exponent is D≈2.0, weakly dependent on the galaxy luminosity, while D=3 at larger scales. In addition, contrary to the case of the observed galaxy samples, no systematic finite-size effects in the counts variance are found at large scales, a result that agrees with the absence of large-scale (r≈100 Mpc/h) correlations in the mock catalogs. We thus conclude that the observed galaxy distribution is characterized by correlations, fluctuations and hence structures, which are larger, both in amplitude and in spatial extension, than those predicted by the standard model LCDM of galaxy formation.},

abstract = {We present cosmological constraints from 2D weak gravitational lensing 
by the large-scale structure in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope
Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) which spans 154 deg2 in five
optical bands. Using accurate photometric redshifts and measured shapes
for 4.2 million galaxies between redshifts of 0.2 and 1.3, we compute
the 2D cosmic shear correlation function over angular scales ranging
between 0.8 and 350 arcmin. Using non-linear models of the dark-matter
power spectrum, we constrain cosmological parameters by exploring the
parameter space with Population Monte Carlo sampling. The best
constraints from lensing alone are obtained for the small-scale
density-fluctuations amplitude $\sigma$8 scaled with the total
matter density $\Omega$m. For a flat $\Lambda$cold dark matter
($\Lambda$CDM) model we obtain
$\sigma$8($\Omega$m/0.27)0.6 = 0.79
± 0.03.

We combine the CFHTLenS data with 7-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP7), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO): SDSS-III (BOSS) and
a Hubble Space Telescope distance-ladder prior on the Hubble constant to
get joint constraints. For a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we find
$\Omega$m = 0.283 ± 0.010 and $\sigma$8 =
0.813 ± 0.014. In the case of a curved wCDM universe, we obtain
$\Omega$m = 0.27 ± 0.03, $\sigma$8 = 0.83
± 0.04, w0 = -1.10 ± 0.15 and
$\Omega$K = 0.006+ 0.006- 0.004.

We calculate the Bayesian evidence to compare flat and curved
$\Lambda$CDM and dark-energy CDM models. From the combination of all four
probes, we find models with curvature to be at moderately disfavoured
with respect to the flat case. A simple dark-energy model is
indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM. Our results therefore do not
necessitate any deviations from the standard cosmological model.},

abstract = {We have designed, developed, and applied a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture using multi-task learning to search for and characterize strong HI Lya absorption in quasar spectra. Without any explicit modeling of the quasar continuum nor application of the predicted line-profile for Lya from quantum mechanics, our algorithm predicts the presence of strong HI absorption and estimates the corresponding redshift zabs and HI column density NHI, with emphasis on damped Lya systems (DLAs, absorbers with log NHI {\textgreater} 20.3). We tuned the CNN model using a custom training set of DLAs injected into DLA-free quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), data release 5 (DR5). Testing on a held-back validation set demonstrates a high incidence of DLAs recovered by the algorithm (97.4{\%} as DLAs and 99{\%} as an HI absorber with log NHI {\textgreater} 19.5) and excellent estimates for zabs and NHI. Similar results are obtained against a human-generated survey of the SDSS DR5 dataset. The algorithm yields a low incidence of false positives and negatives but is challenged by overlapping DLAs and/or very high NHI systems. We have applied this CNN model to the quasar spectra of SDSS-DR7 and the Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS, data release 12) and provide catalogs of 4,913 and 50,969 DLAs respectively (including 1,659 and 9,230 high-confidence DLAs that were previously unpublished). This work validates the application of deep learning techniques to astronomical spectra for both classification and quantitative measurements.},

@article{richards_colors_2001,
abstract = {We present an empirical investigation of the colors of quasars in the 
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometric system. The sample studied
includes 2625 quasars with SDSS photometry: 1759 quasars found during
SDSS spectroscopic commissioning and SDSS follow-up observations on
other telescopes, 50 matches to FIRST quasars, 573 matches to quasars
from the NASA Extragalactic Database, and 243 quasars from two or more
of these sources. The quasars are distributed in a 2.5d wide stripe
centered on the celestial equator covering {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}529 deg2.
Positions (accurate to 0.2") and SDSS magnitudes are given for the 898
quasars known prior to SDSS spectroscopic commissioning. New SDSS
quasars, which range in brightness from i*=15.39 to the photometric
magnitude limit of the survey, represent an increase of over 200{\%} in the
number of known quasars in this area of the sky. The ensemble average of
the observed colors of quasars in the SDSS passbands are well
represented by a power-law continuum with $\alpha$$\nu$=-0.5
(f$\nu${\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}$\nu$$\alpha$) and are close to those
predicted by previous simulations. However, the contributions of the
``small blue (or $\lambda$3000) bump'' and other strong emission lines
have a significant effect upon the colors. The color-redshift relation
exhibits considerable structure, which may be of use in determining
photometric redshifts for quasars from their colors alone. The range of
colors at a given redshift can generally be accounted for by a range in
the optical spectral index with a distribution
$\alpha$$\nu$=-0.5+/-0.65 (95{\%} confidence), but there is a red
tail in the distribution. This tail may be a sign of internal reddening,
especially since fainter objects at a given redshift tend to exhibit
redder colors than the average. Finally, we show that there is a
continuum of properties between quasars and Seyfert galaxies, and we
test the validity of the traditional dividing line (MB=-23)
between the two classes of active galactic nuclei. Based on observations
obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey; with the Apache Point
Observatory 3.5 m telescope, which is owned and operated by the
Astrophysics Research Consortium; with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, which
is a joint project of the University of Texas at Austin, the
Pennsylvania State University, Stanford University,
Ludwig-Maximillians-Universit{\"{a}}t M{\"{u}}nchen, and
Georg-August-Universit{\"{a}}t G{\"{o}}ttingen with the 2.1 m telescope at
Kitt Peak National Observatory; and at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which
is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute
of Technology, the University of California, and NASA and was made
possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

abstract = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) is designed to measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter over a larger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveys of large scale structure. BOSS uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint as i=19.9 over 10,000 square degrees to measure BAO to redshifts z{\textless}0.7. Observations of neutral hydrogen in the Lyman alpha forest in more than 150,000 quasar spectra (g{\textless}22) will constrain BAO over the redshift range 2.15{\textless}z{\textless}3.5. Early results from BOSS include the first detection of the large-scale three-dimensional clustering of the Lyman alpha forest and a strong detection from the Data Release 9 data set of the BAO in the clustering of massive galaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. We project that BOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance D{\_}A to an accuracy of 1.0{\%} at redshifts z=0.3 and z=0.57 and measurements of H(z) to 1.8{\%} and 1.7{\%} at the same redshifts. Forecasts for Lyman alpha forest constraints predict a measurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerate D{\_}A(z) and H{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9{\%} at z{\~{}}2.5 when the survey is complete. Here, we provide an overview of the selection of spectroscopic targets, planning of observations, and analysis of data and data quality of BOSS.},

abstract = {We simulate the formation and chemodynamical evolution of 124 elliptical galaxies using a GRAPE-SPH code that includes various physical processes that are associated with the formation of stellar systems: radiative cooling, star formation, feedback from Type II and Ia supernovae and stellar winds, and chemical enrichment. In our cold dark matter (CDM)-based scenario, galaxies form through the successive merging of subgalaxies with various masses. Their merging histories vary between a major merger at one extreme and a monolithic collapse of a slow-rotating gas cloud at the other extreme. We examine the physical conditions during 151 merging events that occur in our simulation. The basic processes driving the evolution of the metallicity gradients are as follows: (i) destruction by mergers to an extent dependent on the progenitor mass ratio; (ii) regeneration when strong central star formation is induced at a rate dependent on the gas mass of the secondary; and (iii) slow evolution as star formation is induced in the outer regions through late gas accretion. We succeed in reproducing the observed variety of the radial metallicity gradients. The average metallicity gradient $\Delta$log Z/$\Delta$log r =- 0.3 with dispersion of +/- 0.2 and no correlation between gradient and galaxy mass are consistent with observations of Mg2 gradients. The variety of the gradients stems from the difference in the merging histories. Galaxies that form monolithically have steeper gradients, while galaxies that undergo major mergers have shallower gradients. Thus merging histories can, in principle, be inferred from the observed metallicity gradients of present-day galaxies. The observed variation in the metallicity gradients cannot be explained either by monolithic collapse or by major merger alone. Rather it requires a model in which both formation processes arise, such as the present CDM scheme.},

abstract = {We have calulated the redshift space two-point correlation function, zeta(r), for galaxies in the QDOT redshift survey. In the range 1 - 30 h-1 Mpc, the data are well described by a power law zeta(r) approximately equal to (r/r0)-gamma with gamma = 1.27 +/- 0.11 and r0 = 4.82 +/- 0.81 h-1 Mpc. Furthermore, we find that the sample exhibits clear multifractal scaling properties, but with dimensions different from those extracted from the CfA survey. For example, D0 = 2.90, D2 = 2.77 for QDOT on large scales (greater than 10 h-1 Mpc), compared with 2.1 and 1.3 obtained from the CfA survey.; on small scales (less than 10 h-1 Mpc), the correlation dimension for QDOT galaxies is D2 approximately equal to 2.25. The differences in these values between the QDOT data on large and small scales, and between the QDOT and CfA data, provide further evidence that multifractal scaling properties are a useful diagnostic of the dynamics of galaxy clustering.},

abstract = {Observationally confirming spatial homogeneity on sufficiently large cosmological scales is of importance to test one of the underpinning assumptions of cosmology, and is also imperative for correctly interpreting dark energy. A challenging aspect of this is that homogeneity must be probed inside our past lightcone, while observations take place on the lightcone. The star formation history (SFH) in the galaxy fossil record provides a novel way to do this. We calculate the SFH of stacked Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) spectra obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We divide the LRG sample into 12 equal area contiguous sky patches and 10 redshift slices (0.2 {\textless}z {\textless}0.5), which correspond to 120 blocks of volume 0.04Gpc3. Using the SFH in a time period which samples the history of the Universe between look-back times 11.5 to 13.4 Gyrs as a proxy for homogeneity, we calculate the posterior distribution for the excess large-scale variance due to inhomogeneity, and find that the most likely solution is no extra variance at all. At 95{\%} credibility, there is no evidence of deviations larger than 5.8{\%}.},

abstract = {We examine the correlation function $\xi$ of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey 
Luminous Red Galaxy sample at large scales (60 h -1 Mpc {\textless}s {\textless}400 h -1 Mpc) using the final data release (DR7).
Focusing on a quasi-volume-limited (0.16 {\textless}z {\textless}0.36) subsample and
utilizing mock galaxy catalogs, we demonstrate that the observed
baryonic acoustic peak and larger scale signal are consistent with
$\Lambda$CDM at 70{\%}-95{\%} confidence. Fitting data to a non-linear,
redshift-space, template-based model, we constrain the peak position at
s p = 101.7± 3.0 h -1 Mpc when fitting the
range 60 h -1 Mpc {\textless}s {\textless}150 h -1 Mpc
(1$\sigma$ uncertainties). This redshift-space distance s p is
related to the comoving sound horizon scale rs after taking
into account matter-clustering non-linearities, redshift distortions,
and galaxy-clustering bias. Mock catalogs show that the probability that
a DR7-sized sample would not have an identifiable peak is at least {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}10{\%}.
As a consistency check of a fiducial cosmology, we use the observed s
p to obtain the distance D{\_}V≡
((1+z){\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}2D{\_}A{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}2cz/H(z)){\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}{\{}{\{}1{\}}/{\{}3{\}}{\}} relative to the acoustic scale. We find
rs /DV (z = 0.278) = 0.1389 ± 0.0043. This
result is in excellent agreement with Percival et al., who examine
roughly the same data set, but use the power spectrum. Comparison with
other determinations in the literature are also in very good agreement.
The signal of the full sample at 125 h -1 Mpc {\textless}s {\textless}200
h -1 Mpc tends to be high relative to theoretical
expectations; this slight deviation can probably be attributed to sample
variance. We have tested our results against a battery of possible
systematic effects, finding all effects are smaller than our estimated
sample variance.},

abstract = {We study here how the presence of non-zero matter density and a cosmological constant could affect the observation of gravitational waves in Pulsar Timing Arrays. Conventionally, the effect of matter and cosmological constant is included by considering the redshift in frequency due to the expansion. However, there is an additional effect due to the change of coordinate systems from the natural ones in the region where waves are produced to the ones used to measure the pulsar timing residuals. This change is unavoidable as the strong gravitational field in a black hole merger distorts clocks and rules. Harmonic waves produced in such a merger become anharmonic when detected by a cosmological observer. The effect is small but appears to be observable for the type of gravitational waves to which PTA are sensitive and for the favoured values of the cosmological parameters.},

The measurement uses the complete SDSS-III data sample: 168,889 forests and 234,367 quasars from the SDSS Data Release DR12. In addition to the statistical improvement on our previous study using DR11, we have implemented numerous improvements at the analysis level allowing a more accurate measurement of this cross-correlation. We also developed the first simulations of the cross-correlation allowing us to test different aspects of our data analysis and to search for potential systematic errors in the determination of the BAO peak position. We measure the two ratios {\$}D{\_}{\{}H{\}}(z=2.40)/r{\_}{\{}d{\}} = 9.01 \backslashpm 0.36{\$} and {\$}D{\_}{\{}M{\}}(z=2.40)/r{\_}{\{}d{\}} = 35.7 \backslashpm 1.7{\$}, where the errors include marginalization over the non-linear velocity of quasars and the metal - quasar cross-correlation contribution, among other effects.

abstract = {We present constraints on neutrino masses, the primordial fluctuation spectrum from inflation, and other parameters of the $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}Lambda{\$}CDM model, using the one-dimensional Ly$\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}alpha{\$}-forest power spectrum measured by Palanque-Delabrouille et al. (2013) from SDSS-III/BOSS, complemented by Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and other cosmological probes. This paper improves on the previous analysis by Palanque-Delabrouille et al. (2015) by using a more powerful set of calibrating hydrodynamical simulations that reduces uncertainties associated with resolution and box size, by adopting a more flexible set of nuisance parameters for describing the evolution of the intergalactic medium, by including additional freedom to account for systematic uncertainties, and by using Planck 2015 constraints in place of Planck 2013. Fitting Ly$\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}alpha{\$} data alone leads to cosmological parameters in excellent agreement with the values derived independently from CMB data, except for a weak tension on the scalar index {\$}n{\_}s{\$}. Combining BOSS Ly$\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}alpha{\$} with Planck CMB constrains the sum of neutrino masses to $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}sum m\backslash{\_}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}nu {\textless}0.12{\$} eV (95{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}{\%} C.L.) including all identified systematic uncertainties, tighter than our previous limit (0.15 eV) and more robust. Adding Ly$\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}alpha{\$} data to CMB data reduces the uncertainties on the optical depth to reionization $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}tau{\$}, through the correlation of $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}tau{\$} with $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}sigma{\_}8{\$}. Similarly, correlations between cosmological parameters help in constraining the tensor-to-scalar ratio of primordial fluctuations {\$}r{\$}. The tension on {\$}n{\_}s{\$} can be accommodated by allowing for a running {\$}\backslash{\{}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}mathrm d{\}}n{\_}s/\backslash{\{}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}mathrm d\backslash{\}}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}ln k{\$}. Allowing running as a free parameter in the fits does not change the limit on $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}sum m\backslash{\_}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}nu{\$}. We discuss possible interpretations of these results in the context of slow-roll inflation.},

abstract = {We describe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV), a project encompassing three major spectroscopic programs. The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2) is observing hundreds of thousands of Milky Way stars at high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio in the near-infrared. The Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey is obtaining spatially-resolved spectroscopy for thousands of nearby galaxies (median redshift of z = 0.03). The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is mapping the galaxy, quasar, and neutral gas distributions between redshifts z = 0.6 and 3.5 to constrain cosmology using baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and the shape of the power spectrum. Within eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: the SPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-ray AGN and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5-meter Sloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory; observations there began in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second near-infrared spectrograph at the 2.5-meter du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, with observations beginning in early 2017. Observations at both facilities are scheduled to continue through 2020. In keeping with previous SDSS policy, SDSS-IV provides regularly scheduled public data releases; the first one, Data Release 13, was made available in July 2016.},

abstract = {In the standard cosmological framework, the Hubble diagram is interpreted by assuming that the light emitted by standard candles propagates in a spatially homogeneous and isotropic spacetime. However, the light from "point sources"--such as supernovae--probes the Universe on scales where the homogeneity principle is no longer valid. Inhomogeneities are expected to induce a bias and a dispersion of the Hubble diagram. This is investigated by considering a Swiss-cheese cosmological model, which (1) is an exact solution of the Einstein field equations, (2) is strongly inhomogeneous on small scales, but (3) has the same expansion history as a strictly homogeneous and isotropic universe. By simulating Hubble diagrams in such models, we quantify the influence of inhomogeneities on the measurement of the cosmological parameters. Though significant in general, the effects reduce drastically for a universe dominated by the cosmological constant.},

abstract = {We study the effects of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on the formation and evolution of galaxies by using a combination of a cosmological N-body simulation of the concordance Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm and a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. This model is an improved version of the one described by Cora (2006), which now considers the growth of black holes (BHs) as driven by (i) gas accretion during merger-driven starbursts and mergers with other BHs, (ii) accretion during starbursts triggered by disc instabilities and (iii) accretion of gas cooled from quasi-hydrostatic hot gas haloes. It is assumed that feedback from AGN operates in the last case. The model has been calibrated in order to reproduce observational correlations between BH mass and mass, velocity dispersion and absolute magnitudes of the galaxy bulge. AGN feedback has a strong impact on reducing or even suppressing gas cooling, an effect that becomes important at lower redshifts. This phenomenon helps to reproduce the observed galaxy luminosity function (LF) in the optical and near-infrared bands at z = 0, and the cosmic star formation rate and stellar mass functions over a wide redshift range (0 {\textless}z {\textless}5). It also allows us to have a population of massive galaxies already in place at z {\textgreater}1, which are mostly early-type and have older and redder stellar populations than lower mass galaxies, reproducing the observed bimodality in the galaxy colour distribution, and the morphological fractions. The evolution of the optical QSO LF is also reproduced, provided that the presence of a significant fraction of obscured QSOs is assumed. We explore the effects of AGN feedback during starbursts finding that, in order to obtain a good agreement with observations, these need to be strong enough to expel the reheated gas away from the galaxy halo. We also test new, recent prescriptions for dynamical friction time-scales, and find that they produce an earlier formation of elliptical galaxies, and a larger amount of disc instabilities, which compensate the change in the merger frequency such that the properties of z = 0 galaxies remain almost unaffected.},

abstract = {We have investigated the redshift space distortions in the optically selected Durham/UKST Galaxy Redshift Survey using the 2-point galaxy correlation function perpendicular and parallel to the observer's line of sight. We present results for the real space 2-point correlation function, by inverting the optimally estimated projected correlation function and find good agreement with other real space estimates. On small, non-linear scales we observe an elongation of the z-space corelation function contours in the line of sight direction. Our result for the 1-D pairwise rms velocity dispersion is sigma = 416 +- 36 kms{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}-1 which is consistent with those from recent redshift surveys and canonical values, but inconsistent with SCDM or LCDM models. On larger, linear scales we observe a compression of the z-space correlation function contours in the line of sight direction. This is due to the infall of galaxies into overdense regions and the Durham/UKST data favours a value of Omega{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}0.6/b = 0.5, where Omega is the mean mass density of the Universe and b is the linear bias factor which relates the galaxy and mass distributions. Comparison with other optical estimates yield consistent results, with the conclusion that the data does not favour an unbiased critical-density universe.},

abstract = {The Lyman decrement associated with the cumulative effect of HI in QSO absorption systems along the line of sight provides a distinctive feature for identifying galaxies at z{\textgreater}2.5. Colour criteria, which are sensitive to the presence of a Lyman continuum break superposed on an otherwise flat UV spectrum, have been shown, through Keck spectroscopy, to successfully identify a substantial population of star-forming galaxies at 3{\textless}z{\textless}3.5. Such objects have proven to be surprisingly elusive in field galaxy redshift surveys; quantification of their surface densities and morphologies is crucial for determining how and when galaxies formed. The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) observations offer the opportunity to exploit the ubiquitous effect of intergalactic absorption and obtain useful statistical constraints on the redshift distribution of galaxies to considerably fainter limits than the current spectroscopic limits. We model the HI cosmic opacity as a function of redshift, including scattering in resonant lines of the Lyman series and Lyman continuum absorption, and use stellar population synthesis models with a wide variety of ages, metallicities, dust contents and redshifts to derive colour selection criteria that provide a robust separation between high-redshift and low-redshift galaxies. From the HDF images we construct a sample of star-forming galaxies at 2{\textless}z{\textless}4.5. While none of the 60 objects in the HDF having known Keck/Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0{\textless}z{\textless}1.4 is found to contaminate our high-redshift sample, our colour criteria are able to efficiently select the 2.6{\textless}z{\textless}3.2 galaxies identified by Steidel et al. The ultraviolet (and blue) dropout technique opens up the possibility of investigating cosmic star and element formation in the early Universe. We set a lower limit to the ejection rate of heavy elements per unit comoving volume from Type II supernovae at {\textless}z{\textgreater}=2.75 of =3.6x10{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}-4 M{\_}solar yr{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}-1 Mpc{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}-3 (for q{\_}0=0.5 and H{\_}0=50 km s{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}-1 Mpc{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}-1), which is 3 times higher than the local value but still 4 times lower than the rate observed at z =1. At {\textless}z{\textgreater}=4, our lower limit to the cosmic metal ejection rate is =3 times lower than the {\textless}z{\textgreater}=2.75 value. We discuss the implications of these results on models of galaxy formation, and on the chemical enrichment and ionization history of the intergalactic medium.},

While a previous analysis indicated a significant time delay, with a most likely value of 3.4 Gyr, effectively ruling out all previously proposed progenitor models, our analysis shows that the time-delay estimate is dominated by systematic errors, in particular due to uncertainties in the star formation history (SFH). We find that none of the popular progenitor models under consideration can be ruled out with any significant degree of confidence. The inferred time delay is mainly determined by the peak in the assumed SFH. We show that, even with a much larger supernova sample, the time-delay distribution cannot be reliably reconstructed without better constraints on the SFH.},

abstract = {The true peak-peak correlation function of a random Gaussian field in one and in three dimensions is examined. It is shown that the peak-peak correlation function in both one and three dimensions has zeros which do not generally coincide with the zeros of the underlying autocorrelation function. It is found that approximations to the peak-peak correlation function using the thresholded density field are generally inaccurate. The peak-peak correlation function for a linear slice through a given density field, however, is found to be an excellent approximation to the full three-dimensional result. It is concluded that correlation length of the canonical Omega = 1 cold dark matter model is too low compared to the observed cluster-cluster correlation function.},

The results are presented in the color system of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), with realistic photometric error and Galactic extinction. The simulated colors of stars and quasars are compared with observations in the SDSS system and show good agreement. The stellar simulation can be used as a tool to analyze star counts and constrain models of Galactic structure, as well as to identify stars with unusual colors. The simulation can also be used to establish the quasar target selection algorithm for the SDSS.},

(2013), complemented by additional cosmological probes. The interpretation of the measured Ly$\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}alpha{\$} spectrum is done using a second-order Taylor expansion of the simulated power spectrum. BOSS Ly$\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}alpha{\$} data alone provide better bounds than previous Ly$\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}alpha{\$} results, but are still poorly constraining, especially for the sum of neutrino masses $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}sum m\backslash{\_}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}nu{\$}, for which we obtain an upper bound of 1.1{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}eV (95{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}{\%} CL), including systematics for both data and simulations. Ly$\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}alpha{\$} constraints on $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}Lambda{\$}CDM parameters and neutrino masses are compatible with CMB bounds from the Planck collaboration. Interestingly, the combination of Ly$\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}alpha{\$} with CMB data reduces the uncertainties significantly, due to very different directions of degeneracy in parameter space, leading to the strongest cosmological bound to date on the total neutrino mass, $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}sum m\backslash{\_}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}nu {\textless}0.15\backslash{\$}{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}eV at 95{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}{\%} CL (with a best-fit in zero).

This bound is nearly independent of the statistical approach used, and of the different combinations of CMB and BAO data sets considered in this paper in addition to Ly$\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}alpha{\$}. Given the measured values of the two squared mass differences $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}Delta m{\{}\backslashtextasciicircum{\}}2{\$}, this result tends to favor the normal hierarchy scenario against the inverted hierarchy scenario for the masses of the active neutrino species.},

@techreport{gaztanaga_cross-correlation_2011,
abstract = {Cosmological galaxy surveys aim at mapping the largest volumes to test models with techniques such as cluster abundance, cosmic shear correlations or baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), which are designed to be independent of galaxy bias. Here we explore an alternative route to constrain cosmology: sampling more moderate volumes with the cross-correlation of photometric and spectroscopic surveys. We consider the angular galaxy-galaxy autocorrelation in narrow redshift bins and its combination with different probes of weak gravitational lensing (WL) and redshift space distortions (RSD). Including the cross-correlation of these surveys improves by factors of a few the constraints on both the dark energy equation of state w(z) and the cosmic growth history, parametrized by {\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}gamma. The additional information comes from using many narrow redshift bins and from galaxy bias, which is measured both with WL probes and RSD, breaking degeneracies that are present when using each method separately. We show forecasts for a joint w(z) and {\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}gamma figure of merit using linear scales over a deep (i{\textless}24) photometric survey and a brighter (i{\textless}22.5) spectroscopic or very accurate (0.3{\%}) photometric redshift survey. Magnification or shear in the photometric sample produce FoM that are of the same order of magnitude of those of RSD or BAO over the spectroscopic sample. However, the cross-correlation of these probes over the same area yields a FoM that is up to a factor 100 times larger. Magnification alone, without shape measurements, can also be used for these cross-correlations and can produce better results than using shear alone. For a spectroscopic follow-up survey strategy, measuring the spectra of the foreground lenses to perform this cross-correlation provides 5 times better FoM than targeting the higher redshift tail of the galaxy distribution to study BAO over a 2.5 times larger volume.},

abstract = {We present cosmological results from the final galaxy clustering data set of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. Our combined galaxy sample comprises 1.2 million massive galaxies over an effective area of 9329 deg{\^{}}2 and volume of 18.7 Gpc{\^{}}3, divided into three partially overlapping redshift slices centred at effective redshifts 0.38, 0.51, and 0.61. We measure the angular diameter distance DM and Hubble parameter H from the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) method after applying reconstruction to reduce non-linear effects on the BAO feature. Using the anisotropic clustering of the pre-reconstruction density field, we measure the product DM*H from the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and the growth of structure, quantified by f{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}}8(z), from redshift-space distortions (RSD). We combine measurements presented in seven companion papers into a set of consensus values and likelihoods, obtaining constraints that are tighter and more robust than those from any one method. Combined with Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background measurements, our distance scale measurements simultaneously imply curvature {\{}$\backslash$Omega{\}}{\_}K =0.0003+/-0.0026 and a dark energy equation of state parameter w = -1.01+/-0.06, in strong affirmation of the spatially flat cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant ({\{}$\backslash$Lambda{\}}CDM). Our RSD measurements of f{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}}{\_}8, at 6 per cent precision, are similarly consistent with this model. When combined with supernova Ia data, we find H0 = 67.3+/-1.0 km/s/Mpc even for our most general dark energy model, in tension with some direct measurements. Adding extra relativistic species as a degree of freedom loosens the constraint only slightly, to H0 = 67.8+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc. Assuming flat {\{}$\backslash$Lambda{\}}CDM we find {\{}$\backslash$Omega{\}}{\_}m = 0.310+/-0.005 and H0 = 67.6+/-0.5 km/s/Mpc, and we find a 95{\%} upper limit of 0.16 eV/c{\^{}}2 on the neutrino mass sum.},

Statistically significant structure that is well described as
scale-invariant fluctuations with a Gaussian distribution is shown. The rms sky variation, smoothed to a total 10-deg FWHM Gaussian, is 30 +/-5 micro-K for Galactic latitude greater than 20-deg data with the dipole anisotropy removed. The rms cosmic quadrupole amplitude is 13 +/-4 micro-K. The angular autocorrelation of the signal in each radiometer channel and cross-correlation between channels are consistent and give a primordial fluctuation power-law spectrum with index of 1.1 +/-0.5, and an rms-quadrupole-normalized amplitude of 16 +/-4 micro-K. These features are in accord with the Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum predicted by models of inflationary cosmology.},

Black hole masses recently estimated by Magorrian et al. lie systematically above the Mbh-$\sigma$ relation defined by more accurate mass estimates, some by as much as 2 orders of magnitude. The tightness of the Mbh-$\sigma$ relation implies a strong link between black hole formation and the properties of the stellar bulge.},

abstract = {Aims.We test whether the universal initial mass function (UIMF) or the integrated galaxial IMF (IGIMF) can be employed to explain the metallicity distribution (MD) of giants in the Galactic bulge. Methods: We make use of a single-zone chemical evolution model developed for the Milky Way bulge in the context of an inside-out model for the formation of the Galaxy. We checked whether it is possible to constrain the yields above 80 Mȯ by forcing the UIMF and required that the resulting MD matches the observed ones. We also extended the analysis to the bulge of M 31 to investigate a possible variation of the IMF among galactic bulges. Several parameters that have an impact on stellar evolution (star-formation efficiency, gas infall timescale) are varied. Results: We show that it is not possible to satisfactorily reproduce the observed metallicity distribution in the two galactic bulges unless assuming a flatter IMF (x ≤ 1.1) than the universal one. Conclusions: We conlude that it is necessary to assume a variation in the IMF among the various environments.},

abstract = {We present results from an extensive survey of 64 cavities in the X-ray halos of clusters, groups, and normal elliptical galaxies. We show that the evolution of the size of the cavities as they rise in the X-ray atmosphere is inconsistent with the standard model of adiabatic expansion of purely hydrodynamic models. We also note that the majority of the observed bubbles should have already been shredded apart by Rayleigh-Taylor and Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities if they were of purely hydrodynamic nature. Instead, we find that the data agree much better with a model where the cavities are magnetically dominated and inflated by a current-dominated MHD jet model, recently developed by Li and coworkers and Nakamura and coworkers. We conduct complex Monte Carlo simulations of the cavity detection process including incompleteness effects to reproduce the cavity sample's characteristics. We find that the current-dominated model agrees within 1 $\sigma$, whereas the other models can be excluded at {\textgreater}5 $\sigma$ confidence. To bring hydrodynamic models into better agreement, cavities would have to be continuously inflated. However, these assessments are dependent on our correct understanding of the detectability of cavities in X-ray atmospheres and will await confirmation when automated cavity detection tools become available in the future. Our results have considerable impact on the energy budget associated with AGN feedback.},

abstract = {We measure the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) in the galaxy clustering pattern at the highest redshift achieved to date, z= 0.6, using the distribution of N= 132 509 emission-line galaxies in the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. We quantify BAOs using three statistics: the galaxy correlation function, power spectrum and the band-filtered estimator introduced by Xu et al. The results are mutually consistent, corresponding to a 4.0 per cent measurement of the cosmic distance–redshift relation at z= 0.6 [in terms of the acoustic parameter ‘A(z)' introduced by Eisenstein et al., we find A(z= 0.6) = 0.452 ± 0.018]. Both BAOs and power spectrum shape information contribute towards these constraints. The statistical significance of the detection of the acoustic peak in the correlation function, relative to a wiggle-free model, is 3.2$\sigma$. The ratios of our distance measurements to those obtained using BAOs in the distribution of luminous red galaxies at redshifts z= 0.2 and 0.35 are consistent with a flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model that also provides a good fit to the pattern of observed fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation. The addition of the current WiggleZ data results in a ≈30 per cent improvement in the measurement accuracy of a constant equation of state, w, using BAO data alone. Based solely on geometric BAO distance ratios, accelerating expansion (w {\textless}−1/3) is required with a probability of 99.8 per cent, providing a consistency check of conclusions based on supernovae observations. Further improvements in cosmological constraints will result when the WiggleZ survey data set is complete.},

abstract = {Since cosmology is no longer the data-starved science, the problem of how to analyze large data sets best has recently received considerable attention, and Karhunen-Lo{\`{e}}ve eigenvalue methods have been applied to both galaxy redshift surveys and cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps. We present a comprehensive discussion of methods for estimating cosmological parameters from large data sets, which includes the previously published techniques as special cases. We show that both the problem of estimating several parameters jointly and the problem of not knowing the parameters a priori can be readily solved by adding an extra singular value decomposition step. It has recently been argued that the information content in a sky map from a next-generation CMB satellite is sufficient to measure key cosmological parameters (h, $\Omega$, $\Lambda$, etc.) to an accuracy of a few percent or better—in principle. In practice, the data set is so large that both a brute force likelihood analysis and a direct expansion in signal-to-noise eigenmodes will be computationally unfeasible. We argue that it is likely that a Karhunen-Lo{\`{e}}ve approach can nonetheless measure the parameters with close to maximal accuracy, if preceded by an appropriate form of quadratic precompression. We also discuss practical issues regarding parameter estimation from present and future galaxy redshift surveys and illustrate this with a generalized eigenmode analysis of the IRAS 1.2 Jy survey optimized for measuring $\beta$ ≡ $\Omega$0.6/b using redshift space distortions.},

abstract = {We present a general method for calculating the bias and variance of estimators for w(theta) based on galaxy-galaxy (DD), random-random (RR), and galaxy-random (DR) pair counts and describe a procedure for quickly estimating these quantities given an arbitrary two-point correlation function and sampling geometry. These results, based conditionally upon the number counts, are accurate for both high and low number counts. We show explicit analytical results for the variances in the estimators DD/RR, DD/DR, which turn out to be considerably larger than the common wisdom Poisson estimate and report a small bias in DD/DR in addition to that due to the integral constraint. Further, we introduce and recommend an improved estimator (DD - 2DR + RR)/RR, whose variance is nearly Poisson.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of a remarkable concentration of massive galaxies with extended X-ray emission at z spec = 2.506, which contains 11 massive (M * 10 11 M) galaxies in the central 80kpc region (11.6$\sigma$ overdensity). We have spectroscopically confirmed 17 member galaxies with 11 from CO and the remaining ones from H$\alpha$. The X-ray luminosity, stellar mass content and velocity dispersion all point to a collapsed, cluster-sized dark matter halo with mass M 200c = 10 13.9±0.2 M , making it the most distant X-ray-detected cluster known to date. Unlike other clusters discovered so far, this structure is dominated by star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the core with only 2 out of the 11 massive galaxies classified as quiescent. The star formation rate (SFR) in the 80kpc core reaches ∼3400 M yr −1 with a gas depletion time of ∼ 200 Myr, suggesting that we caught this cluster in rapid build-up of a dense core. The high SFR is driven by both a high abundance of SFGs and a higher starburst fraction (∼ 25{\%}, compared to 3{\%}-5{\%} in the field). The presence of both a collapsed, cluster-sized halo and a predominant population of massive SFGs suggests that this structure could represent an important transition phase between protoclusters and mature clusters. It provides evidence that the main phase of massive galaxy passivization will take place after galaxies accrete onto the cluster, providing new insights into massive cluster formation at early epochs. The large integrated stellar mass at such high redshift challenges our understanding of massive cluster formation.},

Our analysis is based on a sample from Data Release 9 of 264,283 galaxies over 3275 square degrees in the redshift range 0.43{\textless}z{\textless}0.70. We use two different methods to provide robust measurement of the acoustic peak position across and along the line of sight in order to measure the cosmological distance scale. We find D{\_}A(0.57) = 1408 +/- 45 Mpc and H(0.57) = 92.9 +/- 7.8 km/s/Mpc for our fiducial value of the sound horizon. These results from the anisotropic fitting are fully consistent with the analysis of the spherically averaged acoustic peak position presented in Anderson et al, 2012. Our distance measurements are a close match to the predictions of the standard cosmological model featuring a cosmological constant and zero spatial curvature.},

@article{ross_clustering_2012,
abstract = {We analyse the density field of galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) included in the SDSS Data Release Nine (DR9). DR9 includes spectroscopic redshifts for over 400 000 galaxies spread over a footprint of 3275 deg2. We identify, characterize and mitigate the impact of sources of systematic uncertainty on large-scale clustering measurements, both for angular moments of the redshift-space correlation function, $\xi$ℓ(s), and the spherically averaged power spectrum, P(k), in order to ensure that robust cosmological constraints will be obtained from these data. A correlation between the projected density of stars and the higher redshift (0.43 {\textless}z {\textless}0.7) galaxy sample (the approximately constant stellar mass threshold ‘CMASS' sample) due to imaging systematics imparts a systematic error that is larger than the statistical error of the clustering measurements at scales s {\textgreater}120 h−1 Mpc or k {\textless}0.01 h Mpc−1. We find that these errors can be ameliorated by weighting galaxies based on their surface brightness and the local stellar density. The clustering of CMASS galaxies found in the Northern and Southern Galactic footprints of the survey generally agrees to within 2$\sigma$. We use mock galaxy catalogues that simulate the CMASS selection function to determine that randomly selecting galaxy redshifts in order to simulate the radial selection function of a random sample imparts the least systematic error on $\xi$ℓ(s) measurements and that this systematic error is negligible for the spherically averaged correlation function, $\xi$0. We find a peak in $\xi$0 at s∼ 200 h−1 Mpc, with a corresponding feature with period ∼0.03 h Mpc−1 in P(k), and find features at least as strong in 4.8 per cent of the mock galaxy catalogues, concluding this feature is likely to be a consequence of cosmic variance. The methods we recommend for the calculation of clustering measurements using the CMASS sample are adopted in companion papers that locate the position of the baryon acoustic oscillation feature, constrain cosmological models using the full shape of $\xi$0 and measure the rate of structure growth.},

abstract = {We present the results of a large library of cosmological N-body simulations, using power-law initial spectra. The nonlinear evolution of the matter power spectra is compared with the predictions of existing analytic scaling formulae based on the work of Hamilton et al. The scaling approach has assumed that highly nonlinear structures obey `stable clustering' and are frozen in proper coordinates. Our results show that, when transformed under the self-similarity scaling, the scale-free spectra define a nonlinear locus that is clearly shallower than would be required under stable clustering. Furthermore, the small-scale nonlinear power increases as both the power-spectrum index n and the density parameter Omega decrease, and this evolution is not well accounted for by the previous scaling formulae. This breakdown of stable clustering can be understood as resulting from the modification of dark-matter haloes by continuing mergers. These effects are naturally included in the analytic `halo model' for nonlinear structure; using this approach we are able to fit both our scale-free results and also our previous CDM data. This approach is more accurate than the commonly-used Peacock--Dodds formula and should be applicable to more general power spectra. Code to evaluate nonlinear power spectra using this method is available from http://as1.chem.nottingham.ac.uk/{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}res/software.html Following publication, we will make the power-law simulation data available through the Virgo website http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/Virgo},

It gives us straightforward information about the scale where clustering dominates and the scale at which homogeneity is reached. We evaluate the correlation dimension, {\$}D{\_}2{\$}, as the local slope of the log--log plot of the {\$}K{\$} function. We apply this statistic to several stochastic point fields, to three numerical simulations describing the distribution of clusters and finally to real galaxy redshift surveys. Four different galaxy catalogues have been analysed using this technique: the Center for Astrophysics I, the Perseus--Pisces redshift surveys (these two lying in our local neighbourhood), the Stromlo--APM and the 1.2 Jy $\backslash${\{}{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}it IRAS{\}} redshift surveys (these two encompassing a larger volume). In all cases, this cumulant quantity shows the fingerprint of the transition to homogeneity. The reliability of the estimates is clearly demonstrated by the results from controllable point sets, such as the segment Cox processes. In the cluster distribution models, as well as in the real galaxy catalogues, we never see long plateaus when plotting {\$}D{\_}2{\$} as a function of the scale, leaving no hope for unbounded fractal distributions.},

This will be the first release of data from the Southern Hemisphere Survey of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2); new data from APOGEE-2 North are also included. DR16 is also notable as the final data release to contain data (spectra) from the main cosmological program of the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS), and all raw and reduced spectra from that project are released here. DR16 also includes the last data from the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) and new data from the SPectroscopic IDentification of ERosita Survey (SPIDERS) programs, both of which co-observed on eBOSS plates. DR16 has no new data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey (or the MaNGA Stellar Library "MaStar"). We also preview future SDSS-V operations (due to start in 2020), and summarize plans for the final SDSS-IV data release (DR17).},

of large-scale fractal behaviour in this catalogue. We find the
correlation dimension in this survey varies with scale, consistent with
other analyses. For example, our results on small and intermediate
scales are consistent those obtained from the QDOT sample, but the
larger PSCz sample allows us to extend the analysis out to much larger
scales. We find firm evidence that the sample becomes homogeneous at
large scales; the correlation dimension of the sample is
D2=2.992+/-0.003 for r{\textgreater}30h-1Mpc. This provides
strong evidence in favour of a universe that obeys the cosmological
principle.},

abstract = {The discovery ten years ago that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating put in place the present cosmological model, in which the Universe is composed of 4{\%} baryons, 20{\%} dark matter, and 76{\%} dark energy. Yet the underlying cause of cosmic acceleration remains a mystery: it could arise from the repulsive gravity of dark energy -- for example, the quantum energy of the vacuum -- or it may signal that General Relativity breaks down on cosmological scales and must be replaced. In these lectures, I present the observational evidence for cosmic acceleration and what it has revealed about dark energy, discuss a few of the theoretical ideas that have been proposed to explain acceleration, and describe the key observational probes that we hope will shed light on this enigma in the coming years.},

abstract = {(abridged) We describe the automated spectral classification, redshift determination, and parameter measurement pipeline in use for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) as of Data Release 9, encompassing 831,000 moderate-resolution optical spectra. We give a review of the algorithms employed, and describe the changes to the pipeline that have been implemented for BOSS relative to previous SDSS-I/II versions, including new sets of stellar, galaxy, and quasar redshift templates. For the color-selected CMASS sample of massive galaxies at redshift 0.4 {\textless}{\~{}} z {\textless}{\~{}} 0.8 targeted by BOSS for the purposes of large-scale cosmological measurements, the pipeline achieves an automated classification success rate of 98.7{\%} and confirms 95.4{\%} of unique CMASS targets as galaxies (with the balance being mostly M stars). Based on visual inspections of a subset of BOSS galaxies, we find that {\~{}}0.2{\%} of confidently reported CMASS sample classifications and redshifts are incorrect, and {\~{}}0.4{\%} of all CMASS spectra are objects unclassified by the current algorithm which are potentially recoverable. The BOSS pipeline confirms that {\~{}}51.5{\%} of the quasar targets have quasar spectra, with the balance mainly consisting of stars. Statistical (as opposed to systematic) redshift errors propagated from photon noise are typically a few tens of km/s for both galaxies and quasars, with a significant tail to a few hundreds of km/s for quasars. We test the accuracy of these statistical redshift error estimates using repeat observations, finding them underestimated by a factor of 1.19 to 1.34 for galaxies, and by a factor of 2 for quasars. We assess the impact of sky-subtraction quality, S/N, and other factors on galaxy redshift success. Finally, we document known issues, and describe directions of ongoing development.},

abstract = {Hydrodynamic simulations of growth of cosmic structure suggest that 30{\%}-50{\%} of the total baryons at z=0 may be in a warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) with temperatures of 105-107 K. The O VI $\lambda$$\lambda$1032, 1038 absorption line doublet in the far-UV portion of quasar spectra provides an important probe of this gas. Utilizing recent hydrodynamic simulations, it is found that there should be about five O VI absorption lines per unit redshift with equivalent widths of {\textgreater}=35 m{\AA}, decreasing rapidly to 0.5 per unit redshift at {\textgreater}=350 m{\AA}. About 10{\%} of the total baryonic matter or 20{\%}-30{\%} of the WHIM is expected to be in the O VI absorption line systems with equivalent width {\textgreater}=20 m{\AA} the remaining WHIM gas may be too hot or have too low a metallicity to be detected in O VI. We find that the simulation results agree well with observations with regard to the line abundance and total mass contained in these systems. Some of the O VI systems are collisionally ionized and some are photoionized, but most of the mass is in the collisionally ionized systems. We show that the gas that produces the O VI absorption lines does not reside in virialized regions such as galaxies, groups, or clusters of galaxies but rather has an overdensity of 10-40 times the average density. These regions form a somewhat connected network of filaments. The typical metallicity of these regions is 0.1-0.3 Zsolar.},

Survey (BOSS) on comoving scales of 4 {\textless}s {\textless}22 Mpc/h. The sample
covers 6950 deg{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}2 ({\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 19 (Gpc/h){\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}3) and, over the redshift range 2.2 {\textless}z {\textless}2.8, contains 55,826 homogeneously selected quasars, which is
twice as many as in any similar work. We deduce b{\_}Q = 3.54 +/- 0.10 ;
the most precise measurement of quasar bias to date at these redshifts.
This corresponds to a host halo mass of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 2 x 10{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}12 {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} M{\_}sun/h with an
implied quasar duty cycle of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}1 percent. The real-space projected

and measure the bias and correlation length of three subsamples over 2.2
{\textless}z {\textless}3.4. We find no significant evolution of r0 or bias over
this range, implying that the host halo mass of quasars decreases
somewhat with increasing redshift. We find quasar clustering remains
similar over a decade in luminosity, contradicting a scenario in which
quasar luminosity is monotonically related to halo mass at z {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 2.5. Our
results are broadly consistent with previous BOSS measurements, but they
yield more precise constraints based upon a larger and more uniform data

abstract = {The hard X-ray ({\textgreater}2 keV) emission of the local and distant universe as observed with the HEAO 1 A-2 experiment is reconsidered in the context of large-scale cosmic structure. Using all-sky X-ray samples of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and galaxy clusters, we remove the dominant local X-ray flux from within a redshift of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.02. We evaluate the dipolar and higher order harmonic structure in four X-ray colors. The estimated dipole anisotropy of the unresolved flux appears to be consistent with a combination of the Compton-Getting effect due to the Local Group motion (dipole amplitude $\Delta$=0.0042) and remaining large-scale structure
(0.0023{\textless}{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}$\Delta${\textless}{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.0085), in good agreement with the expectations
of cold dark matter models. The observed anisotropy does, however, also suggest a nonnegligible Galactic contribution that is more complex than current, simple models of {\textgreater}2 keV Galactic X-ray emission. Comparison of the soft and hard color maps with a harmonic analysis of the 1.5 keV ROSAT all-sky data qualitatively suggests that at least a third of the faint, unresolved {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}18° scale structure in the HEAO 1 A-2 data may be Galactic in origin. However, the effect on measured flux dipoles is small ({\textless}{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}3{\%}). We derive an expression for dipole anisotropy and
acceleration and demonstrate how the dipole anisotropy of the distant X-ray frame can constrain the amplitude of bulk motions of the universe. From observed bulk motions over a local {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}50 h-1 Mpc radius volume, we determine
0.14{\textless}{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}$\Omega$0.60/bX(0){\textless}{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.59,
where $\Omega$0 is the universal density parameter and

abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of “dark energy” with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious efforts to understand its origin, with experiments that aim to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and the abundance of galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit “Stage IV” dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock–Paczynski effect, and direct measurements of the Hubble constant H0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from General Relativity, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background data. We also show the level of precision required for clusters or other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets that support a wide range of scientific investigations, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales.},

abstract = {We measure the star formation rate (SFR) as a function of redshift z up to z 4.5, based on B-, I-, and (I+B)-selected galaxy catalogs from the FORS Deep Field (FDF) and the K-selected catalog from the GOODS-South field. Distances are computed from spectroscopically calibrated photometric redshifts accurate to ?z/(zspec+1){\textless}=0.03 for the FDF and {\textless}=0.056 for the GOODS-South field. The SFRs are derived from the luminosities at 1500 {\AA}. We find that the total SFR estimates derived from B, I, and I+B catalogs agree very well ({\textless}0.1 dex), while the SFR from the K catalog is lower by 0.2 dex. We show that the latter is due solely to the lower star-forming activity of K-selected intermediate- and low-luminosity (L{\textless}L*) galaxies. The SFR of bright (L{\textgreater}L*) galaxies is independent of the selection band, i.e., the same for B-, I-, (I+B)-, and K-selected galaxy samples. At all redshifts, luminous galaxies (L{\textgreater}L*) contribute only approximately one-third to the total SFR. There is no evidence for significant cosmic variance between the SFRs in the FDF and in the GOODS-South field, {\textless}0.1 dex, consistent with theoretical expectations. The SFRs derived here are in excellent agreement with previous measurements, provided that we assume the same faint-end slope of the luminosity function as previous works (? -1.6). However, our deep FDF data indicate a shallower slope of ?=-1.07, implying a SFR lower by 0.3 dex. We find the SFR to be roughly constant up to z 4 and then to decline slowly beyond, if dust extinctions are assumed to be constant with redshift.

abstract = {The scalar averaging approach to cosmology interprets dark energy as the growth of average, void-dominated, negative spatial curvature during the virialisation epoch, leaving the metric a priori unspecified, while models with a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric assume comoving spatial rigidity of metrical properties. The former predicts that voids are hyperbolic and that superclusters occupy positively curved space, and that a best-fit metric should be close to the void case modelled as a constant-curvature metric on a given time slice. Thus, comoving separations near superclusters should be compressed in comparison to the homogeneous case. We demonstrate this by measuring the two-point auto-correlation function on comoving scales in order to detect shifts in the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak location for Large Red Galaxy (LRG) pairs of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. In tangential directions, subsets of pairs overlapping with superclusters or voids show the BAO peak. The tangential BAO peak location for overlap with Nadathur {\&} Hotchkiss superclusters is 4.3{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}pm1.6 Mpc/h less than that for LRG pairs unselected for supercluster overlap, and 6.6{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}pm2.8 Mpc/h less than that of the complementary pairs. Liivamagi et al. superclusters give corresponding differences of 3.7{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}pm2.9 Mpc/h and 6.3{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}pm2.6 Mpc/h, respectively. We have found moderately significant evidence (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests suggest very significant evidence) that the BAO peak location for supercluster-overlapping pairs is compressed by about 6{\%} compared to that of the complementary sample, providing a potential challenge to FLRW models and a benchmark for predictions from backreaction models.},

abstract = {A single parameter, the gravitational growth index $\gamma$, succeeds in characterizing the growth of density perturbations in the linear regime separately from the effects of the cosmic expansion. The parameter is restricted to a very narrow range for models of dark energy obeying the laws of general relativity but can take on distinctly different values in models of beyond-Einstein gravity. Motivated by the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism for testing gravity, we analytically derive and extend the gravitational growth index, or minimal modified gravity, approach to parameterizing beyond-Einstein cosmology. The analytic formalism demonstrates how to apply the growth index parameter to early dark energy, time-varying gravity, DGP braneworld gravity, and some scalar-tensor gravity.},

Fitting the data with a biased cold dark matter model and using a
frequentist analysis (the F-test), we find that models with
luminosity-dependent clustering are statistically favoured at the 95 per
cent confidence level for z {\textgreater}1.3. On the other hand, a number of
tests based on information theory and Bayesian statistics show only
marginal evidence for luminosity-dependent clustering. Anyway, the
quality of the data is not good enough to accurately quantify how quasar
biasing depends on luminosity. We critically discuss the limitations of
our data set and show that a much larger sample is needed to rule out
current models for luminosity segregation. Studying the evolution of the
clustering amplitude with redshift, we detect an increase of the quasar
correlation length with lookback time at the 99.3 per cent confidence
level. Adopting the concordance cosmological model, we discuss the
evolution of quasar biasing with cosmic epoch and show that quasars are
typically hosted by dark matter haloes with mass

abstract = {We study the evolution of linear density fluctuations of free-streaming massive neutrinos at redshift of z{\textless}1000, with an explicit justification on the use of a fluid approximation. We solve the collisionless Boltzmann equation in an Einstein de-Sitter (EdS) universe, truncating the Boltzmann hierarchy at lmax =1 and 2, and compare the resulting density contrast of neutrinos $\delta$fluid$\nu$ with that of the exact solutions of the Boltzmann equation that we derive in this paper. Roughly speaking, the fluid approximation is accurate if neutrinos were already nonrelativistic when the neutrino density fluctuation of a given wave number entered the horizon. We find that the fluid approximation is accurate at subpercent levels for massive neutrinos with m$\nu${\textgreater}0.05 eV at the scale of k≲1.0h Mpc−1 and redshift of z{\textless}100. This result validates the use of the fluid approximation, at least for the most massive species of neutrinos suggested by the neutrino oscillation experiments. We also find that the density contrast calculated from fluid equations (i.e., continuity and Euler equations) becomes a better approximation at a lower redshift, and the accuracy can be further improved by including an anisotropic stress term in the Euler equation. The anisotropic stress term effectively increases the pressure term by a factor of 9/5.},

We consider the $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}Lambda{\$}CDM concordance model of our Universe with $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}Omega{\_}m=0.28{\$}, $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}Omega\backslash{\_}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}Lambda=0.72{\$}, the Hubble constant {\$}H{\_}0=100h{\{}\backslashtextasciitilde{\}}{\$}km s$\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextasciicircum{\}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} Mpc$\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextasciicircum{\}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} with {\$}h=0.72{\$} in our calculations. Dividing the samples into three redshift bins, we find that the LQGs with higher redshift are more biased and correlated than those with lower redshift. The redshift-increasing LQG correlation amplitudes we find is incompatible with that predicted by the standard theory of structure growth. The homogeneity scale {\$}R{\_}H{\$} of the LQG distribution is also deduced. It is defined as the comoving radius of the sphere inside which the number of LQGs {\$}N({\textless}r){\$} is proportional to {\$}r{\{}\backslashtextasciicircum{\}}3{\$} within {\$}1{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}{\%}{\$}, or equivalently above which the correlation dimension of the sample {\$}D{\_}2{\$} is within {\$}1{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}{\%}{\$} of {\$}D{\_}2=3{\$}. For the NFW dark matter halo profile, the homogeneity scales of the LQG distribution are {\$}R{\_}H{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}simeq 224{\$} {\$}h{\{}\backslashtextasciicircum{\}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}Mpc for {\$}0.5{\textless}z{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}leq 1{\$}, {\$}R{\_}H{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}simeq 316{\$} {\$}h{\{}\backslashtextasciicircum{\}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}Mpc for {\$}1{\textless}z{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}leq 1.5{\$}, and {\$}R{\_}H{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}simeq 390{\$} {\$}h{\{}\backslashtextasciicircum{\}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}Mpc for {\$}1.5{\textless}z{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}lesssim 2{\$}. These values are above the characteristic sizes of the LQG samples in each bin, implying the validity of the cosmological principle on the LQG scale, i.e. a length range of {\$}200{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}sim 400{\{}\backslashtextasciitilde{\}}h{\{}\backslashtextasciicircum{\}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}Mpc and a mass scale of $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}sim 10{\{}\backslashtextasciicircum{\}}{\{}14{\}}{\$}M{\$}\backslash{\_}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}odot{\$}. ...},

They never do; this recommends abandoning realism. Despite this, we can adopt a scientifically correct pragmatism and understand aspects of the cosmological model with enormous confidence. I illustrate these points with discussion of one certainty--expansion--and two current controversies--the existence of large extra dimensions and the possibility that the matter distribution forms a fractal on large scales. I argue that the existence of large extra dimensions is certainly plausible, but a fractal universe is untenable.},

abstract = {We combine the quasi-stellar object (QSO) samples from the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ) and the 2dF-Sloan Digital Sky Survey luminous red galaxy (LRG) and QSO Survey (2dF-SDSS LRG and QSO, hereafter 2SLAQ) in order to investigate the clustering of z {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 1.5 QSOs and measure the correlation function ($\xi$). The clustering signal in redshift-space and projected along the sky direction is similar to that previously obtained from the 2QZ sample alone. By fitting functional forms for $\xi$($\sigma$,
$\pi$), the correlation function measured along and across the line of sight, we find, as expected, that $\beta$, the dynamical infall parameter and $\Omega$0m, the cosmological density parameter, are degenerate. However, this degeneracy can be lifted by using linear theory predictions under different cosmological scenarios. Using the combination of the 2QZ and 2SLAQ QSO data, we obtain:
$\beta$QSO(z = 1.5) = 0.60+0.14-0.11, $\Omega$0m = 0.25+0.09-0.07 which imply a value for the QSO bias, b(z = 1.4) = 1.5 +/-0.2.

The combination of the 2QZ with the fainter 2SLAQ QSO sample further reveals that QSO clustering does not depend strongly on luminosity at fixed redshift. This result is inconsistent with the expectation of simple `high peaks' biasing models where more luminous, rare QSOs are assumed to inhabit higher mass haloes. The data are more consistent with models which predict that QSOs of different luminosities reside in haloes of similar mass. By assuming ellipsoidal models for the collapse of density perturbations, we estimate the mass of the dark matter haloes which the QSOs inhabit as {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}3 ×
1012h-1Msolar. We find that this halo mass does not evolve strongly with redshift nor depend on QSO
luminosity. Assuming a range of relations which relate halo to black hole mass, we investigate how black hole mass correlates with luminosity and redshift, and ascertain the relation between Eddington efficiency and black hole mass. Our results suggest that QSOs of different
luminosities may contain black holes of similar mass.},

Starting with the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation applied to the smoothed total density field in real-space, and progressing through redshift-space with no thermal broadening, redshift-space with thermal broadening and hydrodynamicaly simulated baryon fields, we investigate how approximations found in the literature fare. We find that Seljak's 2012 analytical formulae for these bias parameters work surprisingly well in the limit of no thermal broadening and linear redshift-space distortions. We also show that his {\$}b{\_}\backslasheta{\$} formula is exact in the limit of no thermal broadening. Since introduction of thermal broadening significantly affects its value, we speculate that a combination of large-scale measurements of {\$}b{\_}\backslasheta{\$} and the small scale flux PDF might be a sensitive probe of the thermal state of the IGM. We find that large-scale biases derived from the smoothed total matter field are within 10-20$\backslash${\%} to those based on hydrodynamical quantities, in line with other measurements in the literature.},

@article{bryan_resolving_1999,
abstract = {In this paper we critically examine predictions of the Lyalpha forest within the standard cold dark matter (SCDM) model, paying particular attention to the low end of the column-density distribution. We show in particular that the width of these lines, typically measured by the b-parameter of a Voigt profile, is sensitive to spatial resolution in numerical simulations and has previously been overestimated. The new result, which predicts a distribution with a median b of around 20-22 km s{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}-1 at z=3, is substantially below that observed. We examine a number of possible causes of this discrepancy and argue that it is unlikely to be rectified by an increase in the thermal broadening of the absorbing gas but is instead telling us something about the distribution of matter on these scales. Although the median differs, the shape of the b-parameter distribution agrees quite well with that observed, and the high-end tail is naturally produced by the filamentary nature of gravitational collapse in these models. In particular, we demonstrate that lines of sight that obliquely intersect filaments or sheets tend to produce absorption lines with larger b parameters. We also examine the physical nature of the gas that is responsible for the forest, showing that for lines with neutral column densities below N{\_}Hi 10{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}14 cm{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}-2 (for this model at z=3), the peculiar infall velocity is actually slower than the Hubble flow, while larger lines have, on average, turned around and are collapsing.},

In this way, we have accumulated the largest SN statistics ever assembled for this purpose. The new SN rates are corrected on an empirical basis for the bias in the inner regions of galaxies and that in inclined spirals. We also tested an alternative approach based on the simple model proposed by Hatano et al. (1998) for the SN and dust distribution in spirals. It turns out that, although the two approaches give similar average rates, the Hatano et al. model appears to overcorrect the SN rate of distant galaxies. We used these updated statistics to probe the SN rates with different tracers of the star formation activity in galaxies, namely integrated colors, infrared luminosities and nuclear activities. We found a clear relation between the core-collapse SN rate and the integrated galaxy color, which appears consistent with the prediction of galaxy evolutionary models. We also compared SN rates in galaxies with different LFIR with unfavorable outcome, and we argue that LFIR is not a universal measurement of SFR. Finally, we confirm that the SN rate is not enhanced in AGN host galaxies which indicates that the nuclear engine does not significantly stimulate the extranuclear SF.},

abstract = {The assumption that the Universe, on sufficiently large scales, is homogeneous and isotropic is crucial to our current understanding of cosmology. In this Letter, we test if the observed galaxy distribution is actually homogeneous on large scales. We have carried out a
multifractal analysis of the galaxy distribution in a volume-limited subsample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 6. This considers the scaling properties of different moments of galaxy number counts in spheres of varying radius, r, centred on galaxies. This analysis gives the spectrum of generalized dimension Dq(r), where q {\textgreater}0 quantifies the scaling properties in overdense regions and q {\textless}0 in underdense regions. We expect Dq(r) = 3 for a homogeneous, random point distribution. In our analysis, we have determined Dq(r) in the range -4 {\textless}= q {\textless}= 4 and 7 {\textless}=
r {\textless}= 98h-1 Mpc. In addition to the SDSS data, we have analysed several random samples which are homogeneous by construction. Simulated galaxy samples generated from dark matter N-body simulations and the Millennium Run were also analysed. The SDSS data is considered to be homogeneous if the measured Dq is consistent with that of the random samples. We find that the galaxy distribution becomes homogeneous at a length-scale between 60 and 70h-1Mpc. The galaxy distribution, we find, is homogeneous at length-scales greater than 70h-1Mpc. This is consistent with earlier works which find the transition to homogeneity at around 70h-1Mpc.},

831,000 moderate-resolution optical spectra. We give a review of the
algorithms employed, and describe the changes to the pipeline that have
been implemented for BOSS relative to previous SDSS-I/II versions,
including new sets of stellar, galaxy, and quasar redshift templates.
For the color-selected "CMASS" sample of massive galaxies at redshift
0.4 {\textless}{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} z {\textless}{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 0.8 targeted by BOSS for the purposes of large-scale
cosmological measurements, the pipeline achieves an automated
classification success rate of 98.7{\%} and confirms 95.4{\%} of unique CMASS
targets as galaxies (with the balance being mostly M stars). Based on
visual inspections of a subset of BOSS galaxies, we find that
approximately 0.2{\%} of confidently reported CMASS sample classifications
and redshifts are incorrect, and about 0.4{\%} of all CMASS spectra are
objects unclassified by the current algorithm which are potentially
recoverable. The BOSS pipeline confirms that {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}51.5{\%} of the quasar
targets have quasar spectra, with the balance mainly consisting of stars
and low signal-to-noise spectra. Statistical (as opposed to systematic)
redshift errors propagated from photon noise are typically a few tens of
km s-1 for both galaxies and quasars, with a
significant tail to a few hundreds of km s-1 for
quasars. We test the accuracy of these statistical redshift error
estimates using repeat observations, finding them underestimated by a
factor of 1.19-1.34 for galaxies and by a factor of two for quasars. We
assess the impact of sky-subtraction quality, signal-to-noise ratio, and
other factors on galaxy redshift success. Finally, we document known

abstract = {The apparent accelerating expansion of the Universe is forcing us to examine the foundational aspects of the standard model of cosmology -- in particular, the fact that dark energy is a direct consequence of the homogeneity assumption. We discuss the foundations of the assumption of spatial homogeneity, in the case when the Copernican Principle is adopted. We present results that show how (almost-) homogeneity follows from (almost-) isotropy of various observables. The analysis requires the fully nonlinear field equations -- i.e., it is not possible to use second- or higher-order perturbation theory, since one cannot assume a homogeneous and isotropic background. Then we consider what happens if the Copernican Principle is abandoned in our Hubble volume. The simplest models are inhomogeneous but spherically symmetric universes which do not require dark energy to fit the distance modulus. Key problems in these models are to compute the CMB anisotropies and the features of large-scale structure. We review how to construct perturbation theory on a non-homogeneous cosmological background, and discuss the complexities that arise in using this to determine the growth of large-scale structure.},

abstract = {The assumption that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large 
scales is one of the fundamental postulates of cosmology. We have tested
the large-scale homogeneity of the galaxy distribution in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release One (SDSS-DR1) using volume-limited
subsamples extracted from the two equatorial strips that are nearly
two-dimensional. The galaxy distribution was projected on the equatorial
plane and we carried out a 2D multifractal analysis by counting the
number of galaxies inside circles of different radii, r, in the range
5-150h-1Mpc centred on galaxies. Different moments of the
count-in-cells were analysed to identify a range of length-scales
(60-70h-1Mpc to 150h-1Mpc), where the moments show
a power-law scaling behaviour, and to determine the scaling exponent
that gives the spectrum of generalized dimension Dq. If the
galaxy distribution is homogeneous, Dq does not vary with q
and is equal to the Euclidean dimension, which in our case is 2. We find
that Dq varies in the range 1.7-2.2. We also constructed mock
data from random, homogeneous point distributions and from lambda cold
dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM)N-body simulations with bias b= 1, 1.6 and 2,
and analysed these in exactly the same way. The values of Dq
in the random distribution and the unbiased simulations show much
smaller variations and these are not consistent with the actual data.
The biased simulations, however, show larger variations in Dq
and these are consistent with both the random and the actual data.
Interpreting the actual data as a realization of a biased $\Lambda$CDM
universe, we conclude that the galaxy distribution is homogeneous on
scales larger than 60-70h-1Mpc.},

@article{alonso_measuring_2014,
abstract = {We study the possibility of detecting the transition to homogeneity using photometric redshift catalogs. Our method is based on measuring the fractality of the projected galaxy distribution, using angular distances, and relies only on observable quantites. It thus provides a way to test the Cosmological Principle in a model-independent unbiased way. We have tested our method on different synthetic inhomogeneous catalogs, and shown that it is capable of discriminating some fractal models with relatively large fractal dimensions, in spite of the loss of information due to the radial projection. We have also studied the influence of the redshift bin width, photometric redshift errors, bias, non-linear clustering, and surveyed area, on the angular homogeneity index H2 ($\backslash${\{}{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}theta{\}}) in a $\backslash${\{}{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}Lambda{\}}CDM cosmology. The level to which an upcoming galaxy survey will be able to constrain the transition to homogeneity will depend mainly on the total surveyed area and the compactness of the surveyed region. In particular, a Dark Energy Survey (DES)-like survey should be able to easily discriminate certain fractal models with fractal dimensions as large as D2 = 2.95. We believe that this method will have relevant applications for upcoming large photometric redshift surveys, such as DES or the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).},

abstract = {We present detailed clustering measurements from the 2dF Quasi-Stellar Object Redshift Survey (2QZ) in the redshift range 0.8 {\textless}z {\textless}2.1. Using a flux-limited sample of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}14000 objects with effective redshift zeff= 1.47, we estimate the quasar projected correlation function for separations 1 {\textless}r/h-1 Mpc {\textless}20. We find
that the two-point correlation function in real space is well
approximated by a power law with slope $\gamma$= 1.5 +/- 0.2 and comoving correlation length r0=
4.8+0.9-1.5h-1 Mpc. Splitting the sample into three subsets based on redshift, we find evidence for an increase of the clustering amplitude with look-back time. For a fixed $\gamma$, evolution of r0 is detected at the 3.6$\sigma$
confidence level. The ratio between the quasar correlation function and the mass autocorrelation function (derived adopting the concordance cosmological model) is found to be scale-independent. For a linear mass-clustering amplitude $\sigma$8= 0.8, the `bias parameter' decreases from b{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}= 3.9 at zeff= 1.89 to b{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}= 1.8 at
zeff= 1.06. From the observed abundance and clustering, we infer how quasars populate dark matter haloes of different masses. We find that 2QZ quasars sit in haloes with M {\textgreater}1012
Msolar and that the characteristic mass of their host haloes is of the order of 1013 Msolar. The observed clustering is consistent with assuming that the locally observed correlation between black hole mass and host galaxy circular velocity is still valid at z {\textgreater}1. From the fraction of haloes which contain
active quasars, we infer that the characteristic quasar lifetime is tQ{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} afew × 107 yr at z{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 1 and approaches
108 yr at higher redshifts.},

@article{white_clustering_2012,
abstract = {We measure the quasar two-point correlation function over the redshift range 2.2 {\textless}z {\textless}2.8 using data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We use a homogeneous subset of the data consisting of 27 129 quasars with spectroscopic redshifts - by far the largest such sample used for clustering measurements at these redshifts to date. The sample covers 3600 deg2, corresponding to a comoving volume of 9.7 (h−1 Gpc)3 assuming a fiducial $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmology, and it has a median absolute i-band magnitude of −26, k-corrected to z= 2. After accounting for redshift errors we find that the redshift-space correlation function is fitted well by a power law of slope −2 and amplitude s0 = (9.7 ± 0.5) h−1 Mpc over the range 3 {\textless}s {\textless}25 h−1 Mpc. The projected correlation function, which integrates out the effects of peculiar velocities and redshift errors, is fitted well by a power law of slope −1 and r0 = (8.4 ± 0.6) h−1 Mpc over the range 4 {\textless}R {\textless}16 h−1 Mpc. There is no evidence for strong luminosity or redshift dependence to the clustering amplitude, in part because of the limited dynamic range in our sample. Our results are consistent with, but more precise than, previous measurements at similar redshifts. Our measurement of the quasar clustering amplitude implies a bias factor of b ≃ 3.5 for our quasar sample. We compare the data to models to constrain the manner in which quasars occupy dark matter haloes at z∼ 2.4 and infer that such quasars inhabit haloes with a characteristic mass of 〈M〉≃ 1012 h−1 M⊙ with a duty cycle for the quasar activity of 1 per cent.},

abstract = {Quasars are widely believed to be powered by accretion on to supermassive black holes and there is now considerable evidence for a link between mergers, the activity of quasars and the formation of spheroids. Cattaneo, Haehnelt {\&} Rees have demonstrated that a very simple model in which supermassive black holes form and accrete most of their mass in mergers of galaxies of comparable masses can reproduce the observed relation of black hole mass to bulge luminosity if black holes accrete a fraction of the mass in the merging remnant that varies with redshift. Here we investigate whether this simple model can account for the luminosity function of quasars and for the redshift evolution of the quasar population. We simulate hierarchical galaxy formation through the extended Press-Schechter formalism and assume that, when two galaxies of comparable masses merge, their central black holes coalesce and a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant is accreted by the supermassive black hole. We find that the decrease in the merging rate with cosmic time and the depletion in the amount of cold gas available due to star formation are not sufficient to explain the strong decline in the space density of bright quasars since z 2, if the fraction of accreted gas does not decrease at low redshift, as larger and larger structures form, which can potentially host brighter and brighter quasars. Moreover, we need another mechanism besides major mergers to explain the emission from the brightest quasars, and we speculate that fuelling from hot gas may be this mechanism.},

The CIV forest is a weaker tracer of large-scale structure than the Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} forest, but benefits from being accessible at redshifts {\$}z{\textless}2{\$} where the quasar number density from eBOSS is high.

abstract = {We present measurements of the baryon acoustic peak at redshifts z= 0.44, 0.6 and 0.73 in the galaxy correlation function of the final data set of the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. We combine our correlation function with lower redshift measurements from the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey and Sloan Digital Sky Survey, producing a stacked survey correlation function in which the statistical significance of the detection of the baryon acoustic peak is 4.9$\sigma$ relative to a zero-baryon model with no peak. We fit cosmological models to this combined baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data set comprising six distance–redshift data points, and compare the results with similar cosmological fits to the latest compilation of supernovae (SNe) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. The BAO and SNe data sets produce consistent measurements of the equation-of-state w of dark energy, when separately combined with the CMB, providing a powerful check for systematic errors in either of these distance probes. Combining all data sets we determine w=−1.03 ± 0.08 for a flat universe, consistent with a cosmological constant model. Assuming dark energy is a cosmological constant and varying the spatial curvature, we find $\Omega$k=−0.004 ± 0.006.},

abstract = {The WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey is a survey of 240 000 emission-line galaxies in the distant Universe, measured with the AAOmega spectrograph on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). The primary aim of the survey is to precisely measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) imprinted on the spatial distribution of these galaxies at look-back times of 4–8 Gyr.
The target galaxies are selected using ultraviolet (UV) photometry from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer satellite, with a flux limit of NUV {\textless}22.8 mag. We also require that the targets are detected at optical wavelengths, specifically in the range 20.0 {\textless}r {\textless}22.5 mag. We use the Lyman break method applied to the UV colours, with additional optical colour limits, to select high-redshift galaxies. The galaxies generally have strong emission lines, permitting reliable redshift measurements in relatively short exposure times on the AAT. The median redshift of the galaxies is zmed= 0.6. The redshift range containing 90 per cent of the galaxies is 0.2 {\textless}z {\textless}1.0.
The survey will sample a volume of ∼1 Gpc3 over a projected area on the sky of 1000 deg2, with an average target density of 350 deg−2. Detailed forecasts indicate that the survey will measure the BAO scale to better than 2 per cent and the tangential and radial acoustic wave scales to approximately 3 and 5 per cent, respectively. Combining the WiggleZ constraints with existing cosmic microwave background measurements and the latest supernova data, the marginalized uncertainties in the cosmological model are expected to be $\sigma$($\Omega$m) = 0.02 and $\sigma$(w) = 0.07 (for a constant w model). The WiggleZ measurement of w will constitute a robust, precise and independent test of dark energy models.
This paper provides a detailed description of the survey and its design, as well as the spectroscopic observations, data reduction and redshift measurement techniques employed. It also presents an analysis of the properties of the target galaxies, including emission-line diagnostics which show that they are mostly extreme starburst galaxies, and Hubble Space Telescope images, which show that they contain a high fraction of interacting or distorted systems. In conjunction with this paper, we make a public data release of data for the first 100 000 galaxies measured for the project.},

abstract = {We present the final spectroscopic QSO catalogue from the 2dF-SDSS LRG (luminous red galaxy) and QSO (2SLAQ) survey. This is a deep, 18 {\textless}g {\textless}21.85 (extinction corrected), sample aimed at probing in detail the faint end of the broad line active galactic nuclei luminosity
distribution at z {\textless}{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 2.6. The candidate QSOs were selected from SDSS photometry and observed spectroscopically with the 2dF spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. This sample covers an area of
191.9deg2 and contains new spectra of 16326 objects, of which 8764 are QSOs and 7623 are newly discovered [the remainder were
previously identified by the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ) and SDSS]. The full QSO sample (including objects previously observed in the SDSS and 2QZ surveys) contains 12702 QSOs. The new 2SLAQ spectroscopic data set also contains 2343 Galactic stars, including 362 white dwarfs, and 2924 narrow emission-line galaxies with a median redshift of z = 0.22.

We present detailed completeness estimates for the survey, based on modelling of QSO colours, including host-galaxy contributions. This calculation shows that at g {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}= 21.85 QSO colours are significantly affected by the presence of a host galaxy up to redshift z {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 1 in the SDSS ugriz bands. In particular, we see a significant reddening of the objects in g - i towards the fainter g-band magnitudes. This reddening is consistent with the QSO host galaxies being dominated by a stellar population of age at least 2-3Gyr.

The full catalogue, including completeness estimates, is available on-line at http://www.2slaq.info/.},

This sample of more than 100 SNe Ia is the largest set ever collected from a single survey and therefore uniquely powerful for a detailed supernova rate (SNR) calculation. Measurements of the SNR as a function of cosmological time offer a glimpse into the relationship between the star formation rate (SFR) and Type Ia SNR and may provide evidence for the progenitor pathway. We observe a progressively increasing Type Ia SNR between redshifts z 0.3 and 0.8. The Type Ia SNR measurements are consistent with a short time delay (t 1 Gyr) with respect to the SFR, indicating a fairly prompt evolution of SN Ia progenitor systems. We derive a best-fit value of SFR/SNR 580 h-270 Msolar per SN Ia for the conversion factor between the star formation and the SN Ia rates, as determined for a delay time of t 1 Gyr between the SFR and the Type Ia SNR. More complete measurements of the Type Ia SNR at z{\textgreater}1 are necessary to conclusively determine the SFR-SNR relationship and constrain SN Ia evolutionary pathways.},

@article{swanson_methods_2008,
abstract = {As galaxy surveys become larger and more complex, keeping track of the completeness, magnitude limit and other survey parameters as a function of direction on the sky becomes an increasingly challenging
computational task. For example, typical angular masks of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey contain about N = 300000 distinct spherical polygons. Managing masks with such large numbers of polygons becomes intractably slow, particularly for tasks that run in time with a naive algorithm, such as finding which polygons overlap each other. Here we present a `divide-and-conquer' solution to this challenge: we first split the angular mask into pre-defined regions called `pixels', such that each polygon is in only one pixel, and then perform further computations, such as checking for overlap, on the polygons within each pixel
separately. This reduces tasks to , and also reduces the important task of determining in which polygon(s) a point on the sky lies from to , resulting in significant computational speedup. Additionally, we present a method to efficiently convert any angular mask to and from the popular HEALPIX format. This method can be generically applied to convert to and from any desired spherical pixelization. We have implemented these techniques in a new version of the MANGLE software package, which is freely available at http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/mangle/, along with complete documentation and example applications. These new methods should prove quite useful to the astronomical community, and since MANGLE is a generic tool for managing angular masks on a sphere, it has the potential to benefit terrestrial mapmaking applications as well.},

abstract = {I demonstrate by means of high-resolution cosmological simulations, which include modelling of a two-phase interstellar medium, that the dominant mechanism for transporting heavy elements from protogalaxies into the intergalactic medium (IGM) is the merger mechanism as discovered by Gnedin and Ostriker. Direct ejection of the interstellar gas by supernovae plays only a minor role in transporting metals into the IGM; for a realistic cosmological scenario only a small fraction of all metals in the IGM is delivered by the supernova-driven winds, while most of the metals in the IGM are transported by the merger mechanism. As a result, the metallicity distribution in the IGM is highly inhomogeneous, in agreement with studies of the QSO metal absorption systems, and the predicted metallicity distribution of Lyman alpha absorbers as a function of their column density is in excellent agreement with the observational data.},

abstract = {Correlations measured in 3D in the Lyman-alpha forest are contaminated by the presence of the damping wings of high column density (HCD) absorbing systems of neutral hydrogen (HI; having column densities {\$}N(\backslashmathrm{\{}HI{\}}) {\textgreater} 1.6 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}17{\}}\backslash,\backslashmathrm{\{}atoms{\}}\backslash,\backslashmathrm{\{}cm{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}), which extend significantly beyond the redshift-space location of the absorber. We measure this effect as a function of the column density of the HCD absorbers and redshift by measuring 3D flux power spectra in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the Illustris project. Survey pipelines exclude regions containing the largest damping wings. We find that, even after this procedure, there is a scale-dependent correction to the 3D Lyman-alpha forest flux power spectrum from residual contamination. We model this residual using a simple physical model of the HCD absorbers as linearly biased tracers of the matter density distribution, convolved with their Voigt profiles and integrated over the column density distribution function. We recommend the use of this model over existing models used in data analysis, which approximate the damping wings as top-hats and so miss shape information in the extended wings. The simple linear Voigt model is statistically consistent with our simulation results for a mock residual contamination up to small scales ({\$}k {\textless} 1\backslash,h\backslash,\backslashmathrm{\{}Mpc{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}), even though it cannot account for the effect of the highest column density absorbers (which are in any case preferentially removed from survey data) on the smallest scales (e.g., {\$}k {\textgreater} 0.4\backslash,h\backslash,\backslashmathrm{\{}Mpc{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} for small DLAs; {\$}N(\backslashmathrm{\{}HI{\}}) \backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}21{\}}\backslash,\backslashmathrm{\{}atoms{\}}\backslash,\backslashmathrm{\{}cm{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}). Our model is appropriate for an accurate analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillations feature and it is additionally essential for reconstructing the full shape of the 3D flux power spectrum, assuming that the highest column density absorbers are removed.},

universe is one of the major topics in modern Cosmology: the common use
of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker [FWR] metric relies on these

it has been suggested that strong evidence of a fractal distribution

2.93 +/- 0.15 for richness class R {\textgreater}= 1 and R {\textgreater}= 0, respectively.
Therefore D=2 is excluded with high significance also for the cluster

abstract = {We present the Data Release 9 Quasar (DR9Q) catalog from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. The catalog includes all BOSS objects that were targeted as quasar candidates during the survey, are spectrocopically confirmed as quasars via visual inspection, have luminosities Mi[z = 2] {\textless}-20.5 (in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with H0 = 70 km s-1
Mpc-1, $\Omega$M = 0.3, and
$\Omega$$\Lambda$ = 0.7) and either display at least one
emission line with full width at half maximum (FWHM) larger than 500 km s-1 or, if not, have interesting/complex absorption features. It includes as well, known quasars (mostly from SDSS-I and II) that were reobserved by BOSS. This catalog contains 87 822 quasars (78 086 are new discoveries) detected over 3275 deg2 with robust
identification and redshift measured by a combination of principal component eigenspectra newly derived from a training set of 8632 spectra from SDSS-DR7. The number of quasars with z {\textgreater}2.15 (61 931) is {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}2.8 times larger than the number of z {\textgreater}2.15 quasars previously known. Redshifts and FWHMs are provided for the strongest emission lines (C iv, C iii], Mg ii). The catalog identifies 7533 broad absorption line quasars and gives their characteristics. For each object the catalog presents five-band (u, g, r, i, z) CCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the morphology and selection method. The catalog also contains X-ray, ultraviolet, near-infrared, and radio emission properties of the quasars, when available, from other large-area surveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover the wavelength region 3600-10 500 {\AA} at a spectral resolution in the range 1300
{\textless}R {\textless}2500; the spectra can be retrieved from the SDSS Catalog
Archive Server. We also provide a supplemental list of an additional 949 quasars that have been identified, among galaxy targets of the BOSS or among quasar targets after DR9 was frozen.

Catalog is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to

@article{Aubourg2014,
abstract = {We derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energy models from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data. We take advantage of high-precision BAO measurements from galaxy clustering and the Ly-alpha forest (LyaF) in the BOSS survey of SDSS-III. BAO data alone yield a high confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the CMB angular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. Combining BAO and SN data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7{\%} measurement of {\$}H{\_}0=67.3 \backslashpm1.1{\$} km/s/Mpc. This measurement assumes standard pre-recombination physics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature, so agreement with CMB-based estimates that assume a flat LCDM cosmology is an important corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. For open LCDM, our BAO+SN+CMB combination yields {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}m=0.301 \backslashpm 0.008{\$} and curvature {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}k=-0.003 \backslashpm 0.003{\$}. When we allow more general forms of evolving dark energy, the BAO+SN+CMB parameter constraints remain consistent with flat LCDM. While the overall {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\$} of model fits is satisfactory, the LyaF BAO measurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions. Models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at high redshifts remain consistent with our constraints. Expansion history alone yields an upper limit of 0.56 eV on the summed mass of neutrino species, improving to 0.26 eV if we include Planck CMB lensing. Standard dark energy models constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that is high compared to most, but not all, observational estimates. (Abridged)},

abstract = {The baryon acoustic oscillations are a promising route to the precision measure of the cosmological distance scale and hence the measurement of the time evolution of dark energy. We show that the nonlinear degradation of the acoustic signature in the correlations of low-redshift galaxies is a correctable process. By suitable reconstruction of the linear density field, one can sharpen the acoustic peak in the correlation function or, equivalently, restore the higher harmonics of the oscillations in the power spectrum. With this, one can achieve better measurements of the acoustic scale for a given survey volume. Reconstruction is particularly effective at low redshift, where the nonlinearities are worse but where the dark energy density is highest. At z = 0.3, we find that one can reduce the sample variance error bar on the acoustic scale by at least a factor of 2 and in principle by nearly a factor of 4. We discuss the significant implications our results have for the design of galaxy surveys aimed at measuring the distance scale through the acoustic peak.},

abstract = {We present a new measurement of the optical quasar luminosity function (QLF), using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III: Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (SDSS-III: BOSS). From the SDSS-III Data Release Nine, a uniform sample of 22,301 i 21.8 quasars are selected over an area of 2236 deg2, with confirmed spectroscopic redshifts between 2.2 {\textless}z {\textless}3.5, filling in a key part of the luminosity-redshift plane for optical quasar studies. The completeness of the survey is derived through simulated quasar photometry, and this completeness estimate is checked using a sample of quasars selected by their photometric variability within the BOSS footprint. We investigate the level of systematics associated with our quasar sample using the simulations, in the process generating color-redshift relations and a new quasar K-correction. We probe the faint end of the QLF to Mi (z = 2.2) –24.5 and see a clear break in the QLF at all redshifts up to z = 3.5. A log-linear relation (in log $\Phi$* – M*) for a luminosity evolution and density evolution model is found to adequately describe our data within the range 2.2 {\textless}z {\textless}3.5; across this interval the break luminosity increases by a factor of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}2.6 while $\Phi$* declines by a factor of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}8. At z 2.2 our data are reasonably well fit by a pure luminosity evolution model, and only a weak signature of AGN downsizing is seen, in line with recent studies of the hard X-ray luminosity function. We compare our measured QLF to a number of theoretical models and find that models making a variety of assumptions about quasar triggering and halo occupation can fit our data over a wide range of redshifts and luminosities.},

@article{sulentic_fifty_2014,
abstract = {Last year (2013) was more or less the 50th anniversary of the discovery of quasars. It is an interesting time to review what we know (and don't know) about them both empirically and theoretically. These compact sources involving line emitting plasma show extraordinary luminosities extending to one thousand times that of our Milky Way in emitting volumes of a few solar system diameters (log L boi = 44.0 - 48.0 erg s −1 : D=1-3 light months 10 3 - 10 4 gravitational radii). The advent of 8-10 meter class telescopes enables us to study them spectroscopically in ever greater detail. In 2000 we introduced a 4D Eigenvector 1 parameters space involving optical, UV and X- ray measures designed to serve as a 4D equivalent of the 2D H-R diagram so important for depicting the diversity of stellar types and evolutionary states. This diagram has revealed a principal sequence of quasars distinguished by Eddington ratio (proportional to the accretion rate per unit mass). Thus while stellar differences are primarily driven by the mass of a star, quasar differences are apparently driven by the ratio of luminosity-to-mass. Out of this work has emerged the concept of two quasars populations A and B separated at Eddington ratio around 0.2 which maximizes quasar multispectral differences. The mysterious 8{\%} of quasars that are radio-loud belong to population B which are the lowest accretors with the largest black hole masses. Finally we consider the most extreme population A quasars which are the highest accretors and in some cases are among the youngest quasars. We describe how these sources might be exploited as standard candles for cosmology.},

@article{szapudi_cosmic_1999,
abstract = {The errors on statistics measured in finite galaxy catalogues are exhaustively investigated. The theory of errors on factorial moments by Szapudi {\&} Colombi is applied to cumulants via a series expansion method. All results are subsequently extended to the weakly non-linear regime. Together with previous investigations this yields an analytic theory of the errors for moments and connected moments of counts in cells from highly non-linear to weakly non-linear scales. For non-linear functions of unbiased estimators, such as the cumulants, the phenomenon of cosmic bias is identified and computed. Since it is subdued by the cosmic errors in the range of applicability of the theory, correction for it is inconsequential. In addition, the method of Colombi, Szapudi {\&} Szalay concerning sampling effects is generalized, adapting the theory for inhomogeneous galaxy catalogues. While previous work focused on the variance only, the present article calculates the
cross-correlations between moments and connected moments as well for a statistically complete description. The final analytic formulae
representing the full theory are explicit but somewhat complicated. Therefore we have made available a fortran program capable of
calculating the described quantities numerically (for further details e-mail SC at colombi@iap.fr). An important special case is the
evaluation of the errors on the two-point correlation function, for which this should be more accurate than any method put forward
previously. This tool will be immensely useful in the future for assessing the precision of measurements from existing catalogues, as well as aiding the design of new galaxy surveys. To illustrate the applicability of the results and to explore the numerical aspects of the theory qualitatively and quantitatively, the errors and
cross-correlations are predicted under a wide range of assumptions for the future Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The principal results concerning the cumulants $\xi$, Q3 and Q4 is that the relative error is expected to be smaller than 3, 5 and 15per cent, respectively, in the scale range of 1-10h-1Mpc the cosmic bias will be negligible.},

abstract = {We provide scaling relations and fitting formulae for adiabatic cold dark matter cosmologies that account for all baryon effects in the matter transfer function to better than 10{\%} in the large-scale structure regime. They are based upon a physically well-motivated separation of the effects of acoustic oscillations, Compton drag, velocity overshoot, baryon infall, adiabatic damping, Silk damping, and cold dark matter growth suppression. We also find a simpler, more accurate, and better motivated form for the zero-baryon transfer function than previous works. These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction $\Omega$b/$\Omega$0 $\Omega$0h2 + 0.2, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon. We provide a simple but accurate description of this effect and stress that it is not well approximated by a change in the shape parameter $\Gamma$.},

@article{smee_multi-object_2013,
abstract = {We present the design and performance of the multi-object fiber 
spectrographs for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and their upgrade
for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Originally
commissioned in Fall 1999 on the 2.5 m aperture Sloan Telescope at
Apache Point Observatory, the spectrographs produced more than 1.5
million spectra for the SDSS and SDSS-II surveys, enabling a wide
variety of Galactic and extra-galactic science including the first
observation of baryon acoustic oscillations in 2005. The spectrographs
were upgraded in 2009 and are currently in use for BOSS, the flagship
survey of the third-generation SDSS-III project. BOSS will measure
redshifts of 1.35 million massive galaxies to redshift 0.7 and Ly$\alpha$
absorption of 160,000 high redshift quasars over 10,000 deg2
of sky, making percent level measurements of the absolute cosmic
distance scale of the universe and placing tight constraints on the
equation of state of dark energy. The twin multi-object fiber
spectrographs utilize a simple optical layout with reflective
collimators, gratings, all-refractive cameras, and state-of-the-art CCD
detectors to produce hundreds of spectra simultaneously in two channels
over a bandpass covering the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, with
a resolving power R = $\lambda$/FWHM {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 2000. Building on proven heritage,
the spectrographs were upgraded for BOSS with volume-phase holographic
gratings and modern CCD detectors, improving the peak throughput by
nearly a factor of two, extending the bandpass to cover 360 nm {\textless}$\lambda$ {\textless}1000 nm, and increasing the number of fibers from 640 to
1000 per exposure. In this paper we describe the original SDSS
spectrograph design and the upgrades implemented for BOSS, and document
the predicted and measured performances.},

abstract = {The BOSS quasar sample is used to study cosmic homogeneity with a 3D survey in the redshift range {\$}2.2{\textless}z{\textless}2.8{\$}. We measure the count-in-sphere, {\$}N({\textless}\backslash! r){\$}, i.e. the average number of objects around a given object, and its logarithmic derivative, the fractal correlation dimension, {\$}D{\_}2(r){\$}. For a homogeneous distribution {\$}N({\textless}\backslash! r) \backslashpropto r{\^{}}3{\$} and {\$}D{\_}2(r)=3{\$}. Due to the uncertainty on tracer density evolution, 3D surveys can only probe homogeneity up to a redshift dependence, i.e. they probe so-called "spatial isotropy". Our data demonstrate spatial isotropy of the quasar distribution in the redshift range {\$}2.2{\textless}z{\textless}2.8{\$} in a model-independent way, independent of any FLRW fiducial cosmology, resulting in {\$}3-\backslashlangle D{\_}2 \backslashrangle {\textless} 1.7 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$} (2 {\$}\backslashsigma{\$}) over the range {\$}250{\textless}r{\textless}1200 \backslash, h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}Mpc for the quasar distribution. If we assume that quasars do not have a bias much less than unity, this implies spatial isotropy of the matter distribution on large scales. Then, combining with the Copernican principle, we finally get homogeneity of the matter distribution on large scales. Alternatively, using a flat {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM fiducial cosmology with CMB-derived parameters, and measuring the quasar bias relative to this {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model, our data provide a consistency check of the model, in terms of how homogeneous the Universe is on different scales. {\$}D{\_}2(r){\$} is found to be compatible with our {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model on the whole {\$}10{\textless}r{\textless}1200 \backslash, h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}Mpc range. For the matter distribution we obtain {\$}3-\backslashlangle D{\_}2 \backslashrangle {\textless} 5 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}}{\$} (2 {\$}\backslashsigma{\$}) over the range {\$}250{\textless}r{\textless}1200 \backslash, h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}Mpc, consistent with homogeneity on large scales.},

In the wake of this debate, we intend in this Letter to clarify the meaning of the statement transition to homogeneity and of the concept of correlation length. We show that there are two scales, each associated with the fractal and with the
homogeneous regimes of the matter distribution, respectively. The distinction between both scales has deep consequences, for there can be a regime that, despite having small fluctuations around the average density, exhibits large clusters of galaxies.},

@article{Chabanier2020,
abstract = {The Lyman-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} forest is a powerful probe for cosmology, but it is also strongly impacted by galaxy evolution and baryonic processes such as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback, which can redistribute mass and energy on large scales. We constrain the signatures of AGN feedback on the 1D power spectrum of the Lyman-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} forest using a series of eight hydro-cosmological simulations performed with the Adaptative Mesh Refinement code RAMSES. This series starts from the Horizon-AGN simulation and varies the sub-grid parameters for AGN feeding, feedback and stochasticity. These simulations cover the whole plausible range of feedback and feeding parameters according to the resulting galaxy properties. AGNs globally suppress the Lyman-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} power at all scales. On large scales, the energy injection and ionization dominate over the supply of gas mass from AGN-driven galactic winds, thus suppressing power. On small scales, faster cooling of denser gas mitigates the suppression. This effect increases with decreasing redshift. We provide lower and upper limits of this signature at nine redshifts between {\$}z=4.25{\$} and {\$}z=2.0{\$}, making it possible to account for it at post-processing stage in future work given that running simulations without AGN feedback can save considerable amounts of computing resources. Ignoring AGN feedback in cosmological inference analyses leads to strong biases with 2$\backslash${\%} shift on {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8{\$} and 1$\backslash${\%} shift on {\$}n{\_}s{\$}, which represents twice the standards deviation of the current constraints on {\$}n{\_}s{\$}.},

abstract = {We examine recent measurements of the z{\~{}}2.5 intergalactic medium (IGM) which constrain the HI frequency distribution f(N) and the mean free path MFP to ionizing radiation. We argue that line-blending and the clustering of strong absorption-line systems have led previous authors to systematically overestimate the effective Lyman limit opacity, yielding too small of a MFP for the IGM. We further show that recently published measurements of f(N) at log NHI {\~{}} 16 lie in strong disagreement, implying underestimated uncertainty from sample variance and/or systematics like line-saturation. Allowing for a larger uncertainty in the f(N) measurements, we provide a new cubic Hermite spline model for f(N) which reasonably satisfies all of the observational constraints under the assumption of randomly distributed absorption systems. We caution, however, that this formalism is invalid in light of absorber clustering and use a toy model to estimate the effects. Future work must properly account for the non-Poissonian nature of the IGM.},

@article{planck_collaboration_planck_2013,
abstract = {We present the first results based on Planck measurements of the CMB temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. The Planck spectra at high multipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter LCDM cosmology. In this model Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omega{\_}m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an analysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95{\%} upper limit of r{\textless}0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N{\_}eff=3.30+/-0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the summed neutrino mass. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N{\_}eff=3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy. Despite the success of the standard LCDM model, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the CMB power spectrum at low multipoles, as noted previously by the WMAP team. While not of decisive significance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

@article{labini_scale-invariance_1997,
abstract = {Some years ago we proposed a new approach to the analysis of galaxy and cluster correlations based on the concepts and methods of modern statistical Physics. This led to the surprising result that galaxy correlations are fractal and not homogeneous up to the limits of the available catalogs. The usual statistical methods, which are based on the assumption of homogeneity, are therefore inconsistent for all the length scales probed so far, and a new, more general, conceptual framework is necessary to identifythe real physical properties of these structures. In the last few years the 3-d catalogs have been significatively improved and we have extended our methods to the analysis of number counts and angular catalogs. This has led to a complete analysis of all the available data that we present in this review. The result is that galaxy structures are highly irregular and self-similar: all the available data are consistent with each other and show fractal correlations (with dimension {\$}D {\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}simeq 2{\$}) up to the deepest scales probed so far ({\$}1000 {\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}hmp{\$}) and even more as indicated from the new interpretation of the number counts. The evidence for scale-invariance of galaxy clustering is very strong up to {\$}150 {\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}hmp{\$} due to the statistical robustness of the data but becomes progressively weaker (statistically) at larger distances due to the limited data. In These facts lead to fascinating conceptual implications about our knowledge of the universe and to a new scenario for the theoretical challenge in this field.},

abstract = {The standard model of cosmology is based on the existence of homogeneous surfaces as the background arena for structure formation. Homogeneity underpins both general relativistic and modified gravity models and is central to the way in which we interpret observations of the CMB and the galaxy distribution. However, homogeneity cannot be directly observed in the galaxy distribution or CMB, even with perfect observations, since we observe on the past lightcone and not on spatial surfaces. We can directly observe and test for isotropy, but to link this to homogeneity, we need to assume the Copernican Principle. First, we discuss the link between isotropic observations on the past lightcone and isotropic spacetime geometry: what observations do we need to be isotropic in order to deduce spacetime isotropy? Second, we discuss what we can say with the Copernican assumption. The most powerful result is based on the CMB: the vanishing of the dipole, quadrupole and octupole of the CMB is sufficient to impose homogeneity. Real observations lead to near-isotropy on large scales - does this lead to near-homogeneity? There are important partial results, and we discuss why this remains a difficult open question. Thus we are currently unable to prove homogeneity of the Universe on large-scales, even with the Copernican Principle. However we can use observations of the CMB, galaxies and clusters to test homogeneity itself.},

abstract = {We report a detection of the baryon acousticoscillation (BAO) feature in the flux-correlation function of the Ly$\alpha$ forest of high-redshift quasars with a statistical significance of five standard deviations. The study uses 137 562 quasars in the redshift range 2.1 ≤ z ≤ 3.5
from the data release 11 (DR11) of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of SDSS-III. This sample contains three times the number of quasars used in previous studies. The measured position of the BAO peak determines the angular distance, DA(z = 2.34) and expansion rate, H(z = 2.34), both on a scale set by the sound horizon at the drag epoch, rd. We find DA/rd = 11.28 ± 0.65(1$\sigma$)+2.8-1.2 (2$\sigma$)
and DH/rd = 9.18 ± 0.28(1$\sigma$) ±
0.6(2$\sigma$) where DH = c/H. The optimal combination,
{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}DH0.7DA0.3/rd is determined with a precision of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}2{\%}. For the value rd = 147.4 Mpc, consistent with the cosmic microwave background power spectrum measured by Planck, we find DA(z = 2.34) = 1662 ±
96(1$\sigma$) Mpc and H(z = 2.34) = 222 ± 7(1$\sigma$) km
s-1 Mpc-1. Tests with mock catalogs and variations of our analysis procedure have revealed no systematic uncertainties comparable to our statistical errors. Our results agree with the previously reported BAO measurement at the same redshift using the quasar-Ly$\alpha$ forest cross-correlation. The autocorrelation and
cross-correlation approaches are complementary because of the quite different impact of redshift-space distortion on the two measurements. The combined constraints from the two correlation functions imply values of DA/rd that are 7{\%} lower and 7{\%} higher for DH/rd than the predictions of a flat $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological model with the best-fit Planck parameters. With our estimated statistical errors, the significance of this discrepancy is ≈2.5$\sigma$.

abstract = {We use flux-transmission correlations in $\backslash$Lya forests to measure the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). The study uses spectra of 157,783 quasars in the redshift range {\$}2.1\backslashle z \backslashle 3.5{\$} from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 12 (DR12). Besides the statistical improvements on our previous studies using SDSS DR9 and DR11, we have implemented numerous improvements in the analysis procedure, allowing us to construct a physical model of the correlation function and to investigate potential systematic errors in the determination of the BAO peak position. The Hubble distance, {\$}\backslashDHub=c/H(z){\$}, relative to the sound horizon is {\$}\backslashDHub(z=2.33)/r{\_}d=9.07 \backslashpm 0.31{\$}. The best-determined combination of comoving angular-diameter distance, {\$}\backslashDM{\$}, and the Hubble distance is found to be {\$}\backslashDHub{\^{}}{\{}0.7{\}}\backslashDM{\^{}}{\{}0.3{\}}/r{\_}d=13.94\backslashpm0.35{\$}. This value is {\$}1.028\backslashpm0.026{\$} times the prediction of the flat-$\backslash$lcdm model consistent with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy spectrum. The errors include marginalization over the effects of unidentified high-density absorption systems and fluctuations in ultraviolet ionizing radiation. Independently of the CMB measurements, the combination of our results and other BAO observations determine the open-$\backslash$lcdm density parameters to be {\$}\backslashom=0.296 \backslashpm 0.029{\$}, {\$}\backslashol=0.699 \backslashpm 0.100{\$} and {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}k = -0.002 \backslashpm 0.119{\$}.},

abstract = {We present a measurement of the Lyman alpha flux probability distribution function (PDF) measured from a set of eight high resolution quasar spectra with emission redshifts at 3.3 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.8. We carefully study the effect of metal absorption lines on the shape of the PDF. Metals have a larger impact on the PDF measurements at lower redshift, where there are fewer Lyman alpha absorption lines. This may be explained by an increase in the number of metal lines which are blended with Lyman alpha absorption lines toward higher redshift, but may also be due to the presence of fewer metals in the intergalactic medium with increasing lookback time. We also provide a new measurement of the redshift evolution of the effective optical depth, tau{\_}eff, at 2.8 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.6, and find no evidence for a deviation from a power law evolution in the log(tau{\_}eff)-log(1+z) plane. The flux PDF measurements are furthermore of interest for studies of the thermal state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z {\~{}} 3 . By comparing the PDF to state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we place constraints on the temperature of the IGM and compare our results with previous measurements of the PDF at lower redshift. At redshift z=3, our new PDF measurements are consistent with an isothermal temperature-density relation, T=T{\_}0 Delta{\^{}}{\{}gamma-1{\}}, with a temperature at the mean density of T{\_}0 = 19250 +/- 4800 K and a slope gamma=0.90+/-0.21 (1 sigma uncertainties). In comparison, joint constraints with previous PDF measurements at z{\textless}3 favour an inverted (gamma{\textless}1) temperature-density relation with T{\_}0=17900 +/- 3500 K and gamma=0.70 +/- 0.12, in broad agreement with previous analyses.},

abstract = {We simulate the dynamical and chemical evolution of a dwarf galaxy embedded in a dark matter halo, using a three-dimensional N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation code combined with stellar population synthesis. The initial condition is adopted in accord with a 1010 Msolar virialized sphere in a 1 sigma cold dark matter perturbation which contains 10{\%} baryonic mass. A supersonic spherical outflow is driven by the first starburst near the center of the galaxy and produces an expanding supershell in which stars are subsequently formed. Consecutive formation of stars in the expanding shell makes the stellar system settled, with the exponential brightness profile, the positive metallicity gradient, and the inverse color gradient in agreement with observed features of dwarf galaxies. We therefore propose that the energy feedback via stellar winds and supernovae is a decisive mechanism for formation of less compact, small systems like dwarf galaxies.},

abstract = {We report our analysis of the properties of galaxy clustering for a new redshift sample of galaxies, the CfA2-South catalog, using statistical methods that do not rely on the assumption of homogeneity. We find that, up to {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}20 h-1 Mpc, which is the largest scale to which correlation properties can be reliably inferred, the galaxy clustering is scale invariant and characterized by a fractal dimension D=1.9±0.1. Further, there is no statistical evidence for homogeneity at any of the larger scales (up to {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}150 h-1 Mpc) probed more weakly by the catalog. These results mean that characteristic correlation lengths for the clustering of galaxies derived using standard methods of analysis are not meaningful. Further, the results are very consistent with those obtained from many other catalogs using the methods adopted here, which show the D≈2 fractal continuing to beyond 100 h-1 Mpc. The incompleteness of the relevant data conjectured by various authors to give rise to such behavior is therefore proved to have no significant effect (up to 20 h-1 Mpc) on the measured correlations.},

abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11663 deg{\^{}}2 of imaging data, with most of the roughly 2000 deg{\^{}}2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry over 250 deg{\^{}}2 along the Celestial Equator in the Southern Galactic Cap. A coaddition of these data goes roughly two magnitudes fainter than the main survey. The spectroscopy is now complete over a contiguous area of 7500 deg{\^{}}2 in the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog (UCAC-2), reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milli-arcseconds per coordinate. A systematic error in bright galaxy photometr is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat-fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.

abstract = {We use the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 9 (DR9) to detect and measure the position of the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature in the three-dimensional correlation function in the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux fluctuations at a redshift zeff = 2.4. The feature is clearly detected at significance between 3 and 5 sigma (depending on the broadband model and method of error covariance matrix estimation) and is consistent with predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We assess the biases in our method, stability of the error covariance matrix and possible systematic effects. We fit the resulting correlation function with several models that decouple the broadband and acoustic scale information. For an isotropic dilation factor, we measure 100 × ($\alpha$iso − 1) = −1.6+2.0 +4.3 +7.4−2.0 −4.1 −6.8 (stat.) ±1.0 (syst.) (multiple statistical errors denote 1,2 and 3 sigma confidence limits) with respect to the acoustic scale in the fiducial cosmological model (flat $\Lambda$CDM with $\Omega$m = 0.27, h = 0.7). When fitting separately for the radial and transversal dilation factors we find marginalised constraints 100 × ($\alpha${\{}$\backslash$textbar{\}}{\{}$\backslash$textbar{\}} − 1) = −1.3+3.5 +7.6 +12.3−3.3 −6.7 −10.2 (stat.) ±2.0 (syst.) and 100 × ($\alpha$⊥ − 1) = −2.2+7.4 +17−7.1 −15 (stat.) ±3.0 (syst.). The dilation factor measurements are significantly correlated with cross-correlation coefficient of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} −0.55. Errors become significantly non-Gaussian for deviations over 3 standard deviations from best fit value. Because of the data cuts and analysis method, these measurements give tighter constraints than a previous BAO analysis of the BOSS DR9 Lyman-$\alpha$ sample, providing an important consistency test of the standard cosmological model in a new redshift regime.},

abstract = {It is commonplace in discussions of modern cosmology to assert that the early universe began in a special state. Conventionally, cosmologists characterize this fine-tuning in terms of the horizon and flatness problems. I argue that the fine-tuning is real, but these problems aren't the best way to think about it: causal disconnection of separated regions isn't the real problem, and flatness isn't a problem at all. Fine-tuning is better understood in terms of a measure on the space of trajectories: given reasonable conditions in the late universe, the fraction of cosmological histories that were smooth at early times is incredibly tiny. This discussion helps clarify what is required by a complete theory of cosmological initial conditions.},

abstract = {We present optimal measurements of the angular power spectrum of the XDQSOz catalogue of photometric quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These measurements rely on a quadratic maximum likelihood estimator that simultaneously measures the auto- and cross-power spectra of four redshift samples, and provides minimum-variance, unbiased estimates even at the largest angular scales. Since photometric quasars are known to be strongly affected by systematics such as spatially-varying depth and stellar contamination, we introduce a new framework of extended mode projection to robustly mitigate the impact of systematics on the power spectrum measurements. This technique involves constructing template maps of potential systematics, decorrelating them on the sky, and projecting out modes which are significantly correlated with the data. Our method is able to simultaneously process several thousands of nonlinearly-correlated systematics, and mode projection is performed in a blind fashion. Using our final power spectrum measurements, we find a good agreement with theoretical predictions, and no evidence for further contamination by systematics. Extended mode projection not only obviates the need for aggressive sky and quality cuts, but also provides control over the level of systematics in the measurements, enabling the search for small signals of new physics while avoiding confirmation bias.},

abstract = {The imprint of Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) on the matter power spectrum can be constrained using the neutral hydrogen density in the intergalactic medium as a tracer of the matter density. One of the goals of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) is to derive the Hubble expansion rate and the angular scale from the BAO signal in the IGM. To this aim, the Lyman-alpha forest of 10{\^{}}5 quasars will be observed in the redshift range 2.2{\textless}z{\textless}3.5 and over 10,000 deg{\^{}}2. We simulated the BOSS QSO survey to estimate the statistical accuracy on the BAO scale determination provided by such a large scale survey. In particular, we discuss the effect of the poorly constrained estimate of the unabsorbed intrinsic quasar spectrum. The volume of current N-body simulations being too small for such studies, we resorted to Gaussian random field (GRF) simulations. We validated the use of GRFs by comparing the output of GRF simulations with that of the Horizon N-body simulation with the same initial conditions. Realistic mock samples of QSO Lyman-$\backslash$alpha forest were generated; their power spectrum was computed and fitted to obtain the BAO scale. The rms of the results for 100 different simulations provides an estimate of the statistical error expected from the BOSS survey. We confirm the results from Fisher matrix estimate. In the absence of error on the unabsorbed quasar spectrum, the BOSS quasar survey should measure the BAO scale with an error of the order of 2.3{\%}, or the transverse and radial BAO scales separately with errors of the order of 6.8{\%} and 3.9{\%}, respectively. The significance of the BAO detection is assessed by an average $\backslash$Delta$\backslash$chi{\^{}}2=17 but for individual realizations $\backslash$Delta$\backslash$chi{\^{}}2 ranges from 2 t o 35. The error on the unabsorbed quasar spectrum increases the error on the BAO scale by 10 to 20{\%} and results in a sub percent bias.},

abstract = {I reanalyse the Riess et al. (2011, hereafter R11) Cepheid data using the revised geometric maser distance to NGC 4258 of Humphreys et al. (2013). I explore different outlier rejection criteria designed to give a reduced chi-squared of unity and compare the results with the R11 rejection algorithm, which produces a reduced chi-squared that is substantially less than unity and, in some cases, to underestimates of the errors on parameters. I show that there are sub-luminous low metallicity Cepheids in the R11 sample that skew the global fits of the period-luminosity relation. This has a small but non-negligible impact on the global fits using NGC 4258 as a distance scale anchor, but adds a poorly constrained source of systematic error when using the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) as an anchor. I also show that the small Milky Way (MW) Cepheid sample with accurate parallax measurements leads to a distance to NGC 4258 that is in tension with the maser distance. I conclude that H0 based on the NGC 4258 maser distance is H0 = 70.6 +/- 3.3 km/s/Mpc compatible within 1 sigma with the recent determination from Planck for the base six-parameter LCDM cosmology. If the H-band period-luminosity relation is assumed to be independent of metallicity and the three distance anchors are combined, I find H0 = 72.5 +/- 2.5 km/s/Mpc, which differs by 1.9 sigma from the Planck value. The differences between the Planck results and these estimates of H0 are not large enough to provide compelling evidence for new physics at this stage.},

abstract = {The PTOLEMY experiment (Princeton Tritium Observatory for Light, Early-Universe, Massive-Neutrino Yield) aims to achieve the sensitivity required to detect the relic neutrino background through a combination of a large area surface-deposition tritium target, MAC-E filter methods, cryogenic calorimetry, and RF tracking and time-of-flight systems. A small-scale prototype is in operation at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory with the goal of validating the technologies that would enable the design of a 100 gram PTOLEMY. With precision calorimetry in the prototype setup, the limitations from quantum mechanical and Doppler broadening of the tritium target for different substrates will be measured, including graphene substrates. Beyond relic neutrino physics, sterile neutrinos contributing to the dark matter in the universe are allowed by current constraints on partial contributions to the number of active neutrino species in thermal equilibrium in the early universe. The current PTOLEMY prototype is expected to have unique sensitivity in the search for sterile neutrinos with electron-flavor content for masses of 0.1--1keV, where less stringent, 10eV, energy resolution is required.

The survey region covers 0.72 h{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}} Gpc{\^{}}3 over 3816 square degrees and 0.16{\textless}z{\textless}0.47, making it the best sample yet for the study of large-scale structure. We find a well-detected peak in the correlation function at 100h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc separation that is an excellent match to the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This detection demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between z=1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4{\%} fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to z=0.35 to 5{\%} accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation function, we measure the matter density Omega{\_}mh{\^{}}2 to 8{\%} and find agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB acoustic scale, we find Omega{\_}m = 0.273 +- 0.025 + 0.123 (1+w{\_}0) + 0.137 Omega{\_}K. Including the CMB acoustic scale, we find that the spatial curvature is Omega{\_}K=-0.010+-0.009 if the dark energy is a cosmological constant. More generally, our results provide a measurement of cosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy, based on a geometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave background anisotropies. The standard cosmological model convincingly passes these new and robust tests of its fundamental properties.},

sine function; we call these modified magnitudes ``asinh magnitudes.''
For objects detected at signal-to-noise ratios of greater than about 5,
our modified definition is essentially identical to the traditional one;
for fainter objects (including those with a formally negative flux), our
definition is well behaved, tending to a definite value with finite
errors as the flux goes to zero. This new definition is especially
useful when considering the colors of faint objects, as the difference
of two ``asinh'' magnitudes measures the usual flux ratio for bright
objects, while avoiding the problems caused by dividing two very
uncertain values for faint objects. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey data
products will use this scheme to express all magnitudes in their

abstract = {The SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), a five-year spectroscopic survey of 10,000 deg2, achieved first light in late 2009. One of the key goals of BOSS is to measure the signature of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) in the distribution of Ly$\alpha$ absorption from the spectra of a sample of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}150,000 z {\textgreater}2.2 quasars. Along with measuring the angular diameter distance at z 2.5, BOSS will provide the first direct measurement of the expansion rate of the universe at z {\textgreater}2. One of the biggest challenges in achieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars in the redshift range 2.2 {\textless}z {\textless}3.5, where their colors tend to overlap those of the far more numerous stars. During the first year of the BOSS survey, quasar target selection (QTS) methods were developed and tested to meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg–2 in this redshift range, with a goal of 20 out of 40 targets deg–2 allocated to the quasar survey. To achieve these surface densities, the magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g ≤ 22.0 or r ≤ 21.85. While detection of the BAO signature in the distribution of Ly$\alpha$ absorption in quasar spectra does not require a uniform target selection algorithm, many other astrophysical studies do. We have therefore defined a uniformly selected subsample of 20 targets deg–2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50{\%} ({\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}10 z {\textgreater}2.20 quasars deg–2). This CORE subsample will be fixed for Years Two through Five of the survey. For the remaining 20 targets deg–2, we will continue to develop improved selection techniques, including the use of additional data sets beyond the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging data. In this paper, we describe the evolution and implementation of the BOSS QTS algorithms during the first two years of BOSS operations (through 2011 July), in support of the science investigations based on these data, and we analyze the spectra obtained during the first year. During this year, 11,263 new z {\textgreater}2.20 quasars were spectroscopically confirmed by BOSS, roughly double the number of previously known quasars with z {\textgreater}2.20. Our current algorithms select an average of 15 z {\textgreater}2.20 quasars deg–2 from 40 targets deg–2 using single-epoch SDSS imaging. Multi-epoch optical data and data at other wavelengths can further improve the efficiency and completeness of BOSS QTS.},

abstract = {We incorporate a simple scheme for the growth of supermassive black holes into semi-analytic models that follow the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cold dark matter-dominated Universe. We assume that supermassive black holes are formed and fuelled during major mergers. If two galaxies of comparable mass merge, their central black holes coalesce and a few per cent of the gas in the merger remnant is accreted by the new black hole over a time-scale of a few times 107yr. With these simple assumptions, our model not only fits many aspects of the observed evolution of galaxies, but also reproduces quantitatively the observed relation between bulge luminosity and black hole mass in nearby galaxies, the strong evolution of the quasar population with redshift, and the relation between the luminosities of nearby quasars and those of their host galaxies. The strong decline in the number density of quasars from z 2 to z=0 is a result of the combination of three effects: (i) a decrease in the merging rate; (ii) a decrease in the amount of cold gas available to fuel black holes, and (iii) an increase in the time-scale for gas accretion. The predicted decline in the total content of cold gas in galaxies is consistent with that inferred from observations of damped Ly$\alpha$ systems. Our results strongly suggest that the evolution of supermassive black holes, quasars and starburst galaxies is inextricably linked to the hierarchical build-up of galaxies.},

@article{peacock_reconstructing_1994,
abstract = {We describe an attempt to reconstruct the initial conditions for the formation of cosmological large-scale structure, under the assumption of gravitational instability in a Gaussian density field. Information on the power spectrum of the primordial fluctuations is provided by a variety of autocorrelation and cross-correlation analyses on samples of different classes of galaxy and galaxy clusters. These results differ from the desired linear power spectrum because of three modifying effects: bias, non-linear evolution and redshift-space distortions. We show how the latter two effects can be corrected for analytically, allowing the linear mass spectrum to be recovered provided that the bias is independent of scale for a given class of galaxy. We argue that this is a good assumption for large scales, which is well verified in practice. We apply this method to eight independent data sets, and obtain excellent agreement in the estimated linear power spectra for wavelengths $\lambda$ {\textgreater}= 10 h{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}-1{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}} Mpc, given the following conditions.
First, the relative bias factors for Abell clusters, radio galaxies, optical galaxies and IRAS galaxies must be in the ratios b{\_}A{\_}: b{\_}R{\_}: b{\_}0{\_}: b{\_}i{\_} = 4.5: 1.9: 1.3: 1, to within 6 per cent rms. Secondly, the data require a significant degree of redshift-space distortion:
{\{}OMEGA$\backslash${\}}{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}0.6{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}/b{\_}I{\_} = 1.0 +/- 0.2. Thirdly, low values of {\{}OMEGA{\}} and bias are disfavoured because non-linear evolution would spoil the agreement in shape between galaxy and cluster power spectra. The amplitude of the preferred linear power spectrum is only weakly dependent on {\{}OMEGA{\}} and agrees well at large wavelengths with the normalization demanded by the COBE data for a scale-invariant primordial spectrum, provided that {\{}OMEGA{\}} = 1 and gravity-wave anisotropies are negligible. In this case, the shape of the spectrum is extremely well described by a CDM transfer function with an apparent value of the fitting parameter {\{}OMEGA{\}}h = 0.25. Tilted models, for which inflation requires a large gravity-wave contribution to the COBE data, predict too little power at 100-Mpc wavelengths.},

abstract = {Using a homogenous sample of 38,208 quasars with a sky coverage of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}4000 deg2 drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Five quasar catalog, we study the dependence of quasar clustering on luminosity, virial black hole (BH) mass, quasar color, and radio loudness. At z {\textless}2.5, quasar clustering depends weakly on luminosity and virial BH mass, with typical uncertainty levels {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}10{\%} for the measured correlation lengths. These weak dependences are consistent with models in which substantial scatter between quasar luminosity, virial BH mass, and the host dark matter halo mass has diluted any clustering difference, where halo mass is assumed to be the relevant quantity that best correlates with clustering strength. However, the most luminous and most massive quasars are more strongly clustered (at the {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}2$\sigma$ level) than the remainder of the sample, which we attribute to the rapid increase of the bias factor at the high-mass end of host halos. We do not observe a strong dependence of clustering strength on quasar colors within our sample. On the other hand, radio-loud quasars are more strongly clustered than are radio-quiet quasars matched in redshift and optical luminosity (or virial BH mass), consistent with local observations of radio galaxies and radio-loud type 2 active galactic nuclei. Thus, radio-loud quasars reside in more massive and denser environments in the biased halo clustering picture. Using the Sheth et al. (2001) formula for the linear halo bias, the estimated host halo mass for radio-loud quasars is {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}1013 h –1 M ☉, compared to {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}2 × 1012 h –1 M ☉ for radio-quiet quasar hosts at z {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 1.5.},

abstract = {One of the basic assumptions in cosmology is that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales. This assumption is the most important keystone of modern cosmology. In order to verify the homogeneity of galaxy distribution on large scales, we have computed the fractal dimensionality of the galaxy distribution in SDSS-DR4. The fractal dimensionality of the observed spatial geometric bodies is determined with random samples. The redshifts of sample galaxies are in the range 0.01∼0.26. When the scale grows continuously to dozens of Mpc, the fractal dimensionality of the galaxy distribution approaches to 3 consistently. All the 6 samples exhibit obviously a transition scale. For scales larger than the transition scale, the fractal dimensionality DG of the galaxy distribution is very close to 3, the galaxy distribution is homogeneous. This result supports the assumption that the universe is homogeneous on large scales. The transition scale of the sample increases with the luminosity of the sample. This means that the galaxy distribution on small scales is not a of simple fractal distribution, but a multi-fractal distribution. The transition scale of high-luminosity galaxies is very large, the distribution will not become homogeneous till about 100 h−1Mpc.},

abstract = {We determine the number counts and z = 0-5 luminosity function for a well-defined, homogeneous sample of quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We conservatively define the most uniform statistical sample possible, consisting of 15,343 quasars within an effective area of 1622 deg2 that was derived from a parent sample of 46,420 spectroscopically confirmed broad-line quasars in the 5282 deg2 of imaging data from SDSS Data Release 3. The sample extends from i = 15 to 19.1 at z 3 and to i = 20.2 for z 3. The number counts and luminosity function agree well with the results of the Two Degree Field QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ) at redshifts and luminosities at which the SDSS and 2QZ quasar samples overlap, but the SDSS data probe to much higher redshifts than does the 2QZ sample. The number density of luminous quasars peaks between redshifts 2 and 3, although uncertainties in the selection function in this range do not allow us to determine the peak redshift more precisely. Our best-fit model has a flatter bright-end slope at high redshift than at low redshift. For z {\textless}2.4 the data are best fit by a redshift-independent slope of $\beta$ = -3.1 [$\Phi$(L) ∝ L$\beta$]. Above z = 2.4 the slope flattens with redshift to $\beta$ -2.37 at z = 5. This slope change, which is significant at the 5 $\sigma$ level, must be accounted for in models of the evolution of accretion onto supermassive black holes.},

abstract = {As part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) IV the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey ( eBOSS ) will improve measurements of the cosmological distance scale by applying the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) method to quasar samples. eBOSS will adopt two approaches to target quasars over 7500 deg 2 . First, a “CORE” quasar sample will combine the optical selection in ugriz using a likelihood-based routine called XDQSOz , with a mid-IR-optical color cut. eBOSS CORE selection (to g {\textless}22 or r {\textless}22) should return ∼70 deg −2 quasars at redshifts0.9 {\textless}z {\textless}2.2 and ∼7 deg −2 z {\textgreater}2.1 quasars. Second, a selection based on variability in multi-epoch imaging from the Palomar Transient Factory should recover an additional ∼3–4 deg −2 z {\textgreater}2.1 quasars to g {\textless}22.5. A linear model of how imaging systematics affect target density recovers the angular distribution of eBOSS CORE quasars over 96.7{\%} (76.7{\%}) of the SDSS north (south) Galactic Cap area. The eBOSS CORE quasar sample should thus be sufficiently dense and homogeneous over0.9 {\textless}z {\textless}2.2 to yield the first few-percent-level BAO constraint near {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/images/0067-0049/221/2/27/apjs521510ieqn1.gif] $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}barz{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}sim 1.5.{\$} eBOSS quasars at z {\textgreater}2.1 will be used to improve BAO measurements in the Ly $\alpha$ Forest.

At the conclusion of eBOSS , the SDSS will have provided unique spectra for more than 800,000 quasars.},

versatile structure for the pixelization of data on the sphere. An
associated library of computational algorithms and visualization
software supports fast scientific applications executable directly on
discretized spherical maps generated from very large volumes of
astronomical data. Originally developed to address the data processing
and analysis needs of the present generation of cosmic microwave
background experiments (e.g., BOOMERANG, WMAP), HEALPix can be expanded
to meet many of the profound challenges that will arise in confrontation
with the observational output of future missions and experiments,
including, e.g., Planck, Herschel, SAFIR, and the Beyond Einstein
inflation probe. In this paper we consider the requirements and
implementation constraints on a framework that simultaneously enables an
efficient discretization with associated hierarchical indexation and
fast analysis/synthesis of functions defined on the sphere. We
demonstrate how these are explicitly satisfied by HEALPix.},

abstract = {The SDSS-IV/eBOSS has an extensive quasar program that combines several selection methods. Among these, the photometric variability technique provides highly uniform samples, unaffected by the redshift bias of traditional optical-color selections, when {\$}z= 2.7 - 3.5{\$} quasars cross the stellar locus or when host galaxy light affects quasar colors at {\$}z {\textless}0.9{\$}. Here, we present the variability selection of quasars in eBOSS, focusing on a specific program that led to a sample of 13,876 quasars to {\$}g{\_}\backslash{\{}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}rm dered{\}}=22.5{\$} over a 94.5 deg$\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextasciicircum{\}}2{\$} region in Stripe 82, an areal density 1.5 times higher than over the rest of the eBOSS footprint. We use these variability-selected data to provide a new measurement of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) in the redshift range {\$}0.68{\textless}z{\textless}4.0{\$}. Our sample is denser, reaches deeper than those used in previous studies of the QLF, and is among the largest ones. At the faint end, our QLF extends to {\$}M{\_}g(z{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}!={\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}!2)=-21.80{\$} at low redshift and to {\$}M{\_}g(z{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}!={\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}!2)=-26.20{\$} at {\$}z{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}sim 4{\$}. We fit the QLF using two independent double-power-law models with ten free parameters each. The first model is a pure luminosity-function evolution (PLE) with bright-end and faint-end slopes allowed to be different on either side of {\$}z=2.2{\$}. The other is a simple PLE at {\$}z{\textless}2.2{\$}, combined with a model that comprises both luminosity and density evolution (LEDE) at {\$}z{\textgreater}2.2{\$}. Both models are constrained to be continuous at {\$}z=2.2{\$}. They present a flattening of the bright-end slope at large redshift. The LEDE model indicates a reduction of the break density with increasing redshift, but the evolution of the break magnitude depends on the parameterization. The models are in excellent accord, predicting quasar counts that agree within 0.3{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}{\%} (resp., 1.1{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}{\%}) to {\$}g{\textless}22.5{\$} (resp., {\$}g{\textless}23{\$}). The models are also in good agreement over the entire redshift range with models from previous studies.},

abstract = {Aims:The maximum-likelihood method is the standard approach to obtain 
model fits to observational data and the corresponding confidence
regions. We investigate possible sources of bias in the log-likelihood
function and its subsequent analysis, focusing on estimators of the
inverse covariance matrix. Furthermore, we study under which
circumstances the estimated covariance matrix is invertible. Methods: We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the
behaviour of estimators for the inverse covariance matrix, depending on
the number of independent data sets and the number of variables of the
data vectors. Results: We find that the inverse of the
maximum-likelihood estimator of the covariance is biased, the amount of
bias depending on the ratio of the number of bins (data vector
variables), p, to the number of data sets, n. This bias inevitably leads
to an - in extreme cases catastrophic - underestimation of the size of
confidence regions. We report on a method to remove this bias for the
idealised case of Gaussian noise and statistically independent data
vectors. Moreover, we demonstrate that marginalisation over parameters
introduces a bias into the marginalised log-likelihood function.
Measures of the sizes of confidence regions suffer from the same
problem. Furthermore, we give an analytic proof for the fact that the
estimated covariance matrix is singular if p{\textgreater}n.},

The measurement of the detection efficiency, using a Monte Carlo simulation, provides the type Ia supernova explosion rate at a redshift ˜0.13. The result is 0.125+0.044+0.028-0.034-0.028 h702 SNu where 1 SNu = 1 SN / 1010 LȯB / century.

@article{coleman_fractal_1992,
abstract = {We re-evaluate the experimental data concerning the large scale structure of the universe utilizing the theoretical methods of modern statistical mechanics. This allows us to test the implicit assumptions of analyticity and homogeneity present in the usual analysis. The results are quite surprising: the previous methods of analysis are mathematically inconsistent for all the cases that can be explicitly tested. In view of the untested homogeneity assumption, these methods give rise to a finite correlation length even in systems that do not possess one (i.e. those with long range power law correlations). In particular, we demonstrate that the famous galaxy correlation length r0≈5h−1 Mpc is a spurious result due to these inconsistencies. In fact it is related to the cut-off due to the finiteness of the sample and not to the correlation properties of galaxies. We can therefore predict that the value of r0 will increase with sample depth when deeper complete catalogs are available. The reanalysis of galaxy and cluster catalogs without any assumption shows long range (fractal) correlations up to the sample limits. This explains the previous contradiction between the correlation analysis and the observation of large scale structures like voids and superclusters. The correlation length, in fact, cannot be much smaller than the size of the largest structures one can observe. We also consider the angular projection of systems with long range correlations and explain why the angular distributions appear to be more homogeneous than the three dimensional ones. These studies are then generalized by an analysis of the whole distribution of visible matter (by including an estimate of the galaxy masses) which shows well defined multifractal properties. This allows one to clarify various other problems such as the so-called “luminosity segregation” phenomenon and the “richness-clustering” relation. In addition the multifractal behavior implies that the upper cut-off of the luminosity function scales with the size of the sample with a characteristic exponent which we determine. This fact has direct implications for galaxy number counts and for several other problems. One may even conjecture in this respect, that quasars may actually represent the continuation of this scaling behavior to much larger scales. In summary a new picture appears which is fundamentally different from the usual one but actually much simpler: the distribution of visible matter in the universe appears to be fractal and multifractal up to the present observational limits (200 Mpc; about one twentieth of the Hubble radius of the entire universe) without any evidence for homogenization. This implies that the nature of the distribution is strongly non-analytic and no simple average density can be defined. These results have profound consequences for our knowledge of the properties of the universe as well as for the theoretical framework that one should use to describe it.},

abstract = {We show that the measurement of the baryonic acoustic oscillations in large high-redshift galaxy surveys offers a precision route to the measurement of dark energy. The cosmic microwave background provides the scale of the oscillations as a standard ruler that can be measured in the clustering of galaxies, thereby yielding the Hubble parameter and angular diameter distance as a function of redshift. This, in turn, enables one to probe dark energy. We use a Fisher matrix formalism to study the statistical errors for redshift surveys up to z = 3 and report errors on cosmography while marginalizing over a large number of cosmological parameters, including a time-dependent equation of state. With redshift surveys combined with cosmic microwave background satellite data, we achieve errors of 0.037 on $\Omega$X, 0.10 on w(z = 0.8), and 0.28 on dw(z)/dz for the cosmological constant model. Models with less negative w(z) permit tighter constraints. We test and discuss the dependence of performance on redshift, survey conditions, and the fiducial model. We find results that are competitive with the performance of future Type Ia supernova surveys. We conclude that redshift surveys offer a promising independent route to the measurement of dark energy.},

abstract = {Measuring the mass of the dark matter halos that host quasars is a critical question in the field of galaxy evolution. Estimates of how the mean mass of the dark matter halos in which quasars are triggered evolves with time can potentially constrain scenarios in which the quasar phase is triggered in different dark-matter environments as the Universe progresses. Quasar clustering measurements on linear scales across a range of redshifts is a powerful tool with which to estimate the masses of the dark matter halos that are inhabited by the galaxies that host quasars. Although there are many measurements of quasar clustering at redshift z {\textless}2.2, and a few at z {\textgreater}3, there
are very few precise measurements around 2.5, where the quasar phase appears to peak before declining at z {\textless}2. The SDSS-III/BOSS
survey targets redshifts of 2.2 {\textless}z {\textless}3.5, and should
therefore offer the most precise estimates of quasar clustering near the epoch of peak quasar activity. We use data from SDSS-III/BOSS to measure the clustering of quasars over the redshift range 2.2 {\textless}z {\textless}2.8 via the real and redshift space two point correlation functions. The data consists of a homogeneously selected sample of 62960 BOSS CORE quasars drawn from SDSS DR11. Our homogeneous sample covers {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}4460 (deg){\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}2 corresponding to a comoving volume of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}12 (Gpc/h){\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}3. We obtain the correlation length of quasars near 2.5 and derive the bias of the dark matter halos that host quasars. We study the mass of the dark matter environments of quasars using the formalism of the Halo
Occupation Distribution (HOD). We will discuss our results at 2.5, and also results obtained by dividing the BOSS quasar sample into three redshift ranges to study how the correlation length, bias, and dark matter halo mass of quasars evolve over this key redshift range.},

{\textless}35 h-1 kpc may trace merging galaxies, with typical
dynamical merger times td{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}(610+/-260)m-1/2

UV-excess quasars at {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}28 h-1 kpc cluster {\textgreater}5 times higher
at z{\textgreater}2 than at z{\textless}2, at the 2.0 $\sigma$ level. However, as the
space density of quasars declines as z increases, an excess of quasar
binaries (over expectation) at z{\textgreater}2 could be consistent with reduced
merger rates at z{\textgreater}2 for the galaxies forming UV-excess quasars.
Comparing our clustering at {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}28 h-1 kpc to a $\xi$(r)=(r/4.8

any excess of a factor of 4.3+/-1.3, which, noting some caveats, differs
from large excesses recently measured for binary quasars, at 2.2
$\sigma$. We speculate that binary quasar surveys that are biased to
z{\textgreater}2 may find inflated clustering excesses when compared to models fit
at z{\textless}2. We provide details of 111 photometrically classified quasar
pairs with separations {\textless}0.1'. Spectroscopy of these pairs could

abstract = {Context. The imprint of baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) on the matter power spectrum can be constrained using the neutral hydrogen density in the intergalactic medium (IGM) as a tracer of the matter density. One of the goals of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) is to derive the Hubble expansion rate and the angular scale from the BAO signal in the IGM. To this aim, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest about 150 000 quasars will be observed in the redshift range 2.2 {\textless}z {\textless}3.5 and over {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}10 000 deg2. Aims: We simulated the BOSS QSO survey to estimate the statistical accuracy on the BAO scale determination provided by such a large-scale survey. In particular, we discuss the effect of the poorly constrained estimate of the quasar's unabsorbed intrinsic spectrum. Methods: The volume of current N-body simulations being too small for such studies, we resorted to Gaussian random field (GRF) simulations. We validated the use of GRFs by comparing the output of GRF simulations with that of the Horizon-4$\Pi$ N-body dark-matter-only simulation with the same initial conditions. Realistic mock samples of QSO Lyman-$\alpha$ forest were generated and their power spectrum computed and fitted to obtain the BAO scale. The rms of the results for 100 different simulations provides an estimate of the statistical error expected from the BOSS survey. Results: We confirm the results from the Fisher matrix estimate. In the absence of error on the quasar's unabsorbed spectrum, our simulations give an expected uncertainty of 2.3{\%} for the BOSS quasar survey measurement of the BAO scale. The expected uncertainties for the transverse and radial BAO scales are 6.8{\%} and 3.9{\%}, respectively. The significance of the BAO detection is assessed by an average $\Delta$$\chi$2 = 17 but $\Delta$$\chi$2 ranges from 2 to 35 for individual realizations. The error on the quasar's unabsorbed spectrum increases the error on the BAO scale by 10 to 20{\%} and results in a subpercent bias.},

@article{Aghanim2019,
abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, which was dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched on 14 May 2009. It scanned the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12 August 2009 and 23 October 2013, producing deep, high-resolution, all-sky maps in nine frequency bands from 30 to 857GHz. This paper presents the cosmological legacy of Planck, which currently provides our strongest constraints on the parameters of the standard cosmological model and some of the tightest limits available on deviations from that model. The 6-parameter LCDM model continues to provide an excellent fit to the cosmic microwave background data at high and low redshift, describing the cosmological information in over a billion map pixels with just six parameters. With 18 peaks in the temperature and polarization angular power spectra constrained well, Planck measures five of the six parameters to better than 1{\%} (simultaneously), with the best-determined parameter (theta{\_}*) now known to 0.03{\%}. We describe the multi-component sky as seen by Planck, the success of the LCDM model, and the connection to lower-redshift probes of structure formation. We also give a comprehensive summary of the major changes introduced in this 2018 release. The Planck data, alone and in combination with other probes, provide stringent constraints on our models of the early Universe and the large-scale structure within which all astrophysical objects form and evolve. We discuss some lessons learned from the Planck mission, and highlight areas ripe for further experimental advances.},

The origin of this phenomenon unambiguously implicates new physics via a novel form of matter exerting negative pressure or an alteration to Einstein's general relativity. These profound consequences have inspired a new generation of cosmological surveys that will measure the influence of dark energy using various techniques. One of the forerunners is the WiggleZ Survey at the Anglo-Australian Telescope, a new large-scale high-redshift galaxy survey that is now 50{\%} complete and scheduled to finish in 2010. The WiggleZ project is aiming to map the cosmic expansion history using delicate features in the galaxy clustering pattern imprinted 13.7 billion years ago.

abstract = {We develop a general method for power-spectrum analysis of 
three-dimensional redshift surveys. We present rigorous analytical 
estimates for the statistical uncertainty in the power, and we are able 
to derive a rigorous optimal weighting scheme under the reasonable (and 
largely empirically verified) assumption that the long-wavelength 
Fourier components are Gaussian-distributed. We apply the formalism to 
the updated one-in-six Queen Mary College, Durham, Oxford, and Toronto 
(QDOT) IRAS redshift survey and compare our results with data from other 
probes: APM angular correlations and the CfA and the Berkeley 1.2 Jy 
IRAS redshift surveys. Our results bear out and further quantify the 
impression from, e.g., counts-in-cells analysis that there is extra 
power on large scales as compared to the standard cold dark matter (CDM) 
model with (Omega h) approx. = 0.5. We apply likelihood analysis using 
the CDM spectrum with (Omega h) as a free parameter as a 
phenomenological family of models; we find the best-fitting parameters 
in redshift space and transform the results to real space. Finally, we 
calculate the distribution of the estimated long-wavelength power. This 
agrees remarkably well with the exponential distribution expected for 
Gaussian fluctuations, even out to powers of 10 times the mean. Our 
results thus reveal no trace of periodicity or other non-Gaussian 
behavior.},

abstract = {We describe the goals, design, implementation, and initial progress of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), a seven year sky survey which began in May 2005, using the UKIRT Wide Field Camera. It is a portfolio of five survey components covering various combinations of the filter set ZYJHK and H{\_}2. The Large Area Survey, the Galactic Clusters Survey, and the Galactic Plane Survey cover approximately 7000 square degrees to a depth of K{\~{}}18; the Deep Extragalactic Survey covers 35 square degrees to K{\~{}}21, and the Ultra Deep Survey covers 0.77 square degrees to K{\~{}}23. Summed together UKIDSS is 12 times larger in effective volume than the 2MASS survey. The prime aim of UKIDSS is to provide a long term astronomical legacy database; the design is however driven by a series of specific goals -- for example to find the nearest and faintest sub-stellar objects; to discover Population II brown dwarfs, if they exist; to determine the substellar mass function; to break the z=7 quasar barrier; to determine the epoch of re-ionisation; to measure the growth of structure from z=3 to the present day; to determine the epoch of spheroid formation; and to map the Milky Way through the dust, to several kpc. The survey data are being uniformly processed, and released in stages through the WFCAM Science Archive (WSA : http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). Before the formal survey began, UKIRT and the UKIDSS consortium collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of small science verification (SV) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera. We show some results from these SV projects in order to demonstrate the likely power of the eventual complete survey. Finally, using the data from the First Data Release we assess how well UKIDSS is meeting its design targets so far.},

abstract = {Observations of redshift-space distortions in spectroscopic galaxy 
surveys offer an attractive method for measuring the build-up of
cosmological structure, which depends both on the expansion rate of the
Universe and on our theory of gravity. The statistical precision with
which redshift-space distortions can now be measured demands better
control of our theoretical systematic errors. While many recent studies
focus on understanding dark matter clustering in redshift space,
galaxies occupy special places in the universe: dark matter haloes. In
our detailed study of halo clustering and velocity statistics in 67.5
h-3 Gpc3 of N-body simulations, we uncover a
complex dependence of redshift-space clustering on halo bias. We
identify two distinct corrections which affect the halo redshift-space
correlation function on quasi-linear scales (˜30-80 h-1
Mpc): the non-linear mapping between real-space and redshift-space
positions, and the non-linear suppression of power in the velocity
divergence field. We model the first non-perturbatively using the
scale-dependent Gaussian streaming model, which we show is accurate at
the {\textless}0.5 (2) per cent level in transforming real-space clustering and
velocity statistics into redshift space on scales s {\textgreater}10 (s {\textgreater}25)
h-1 Mpc for the monopole (quadrupole) halo correlation
functions. The dominant correction to the Kaiser limit in this model
scales like b3. We use standard perturbation theory to
predict the real-space pairwise halo velocity statistics. Our fully
analytic model is accurate at the 2 per cent level only on scales s {\textgreater}40 h-1 Mpc for the range of halo masses we studied (with b=
1.4-2.8). We find that recent models of halo redshift-space clustering
that neglect the corrections from the bispectrum and higher order terms
from the non-linear real-space to redshift-space mapping will not have
the accuracy required for current and future observational analyses.
Finally, we note that our simulation results confirm the essential but
non-trivial assumption that on large scales, the bias inferred from the
real-space clustering of haloes is the same as the one that determines
their pairwise infall velocity amplitude at the per cent level.},

abstract = {The spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) galaxy sample represents the final set of galaxies observed using the original SDSS target selection criteria. We analyse the clustering of galaxies within this sample, including both the luminous red galaxy and main samples, and also include the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey data. In total, this sample comprises 893 319 galaxies over 9100 deg2. Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) are observed in power spectra measured for different slices in redshift; this allows us to constrain the distance–redshift relation at multiple epochs. We achieve a distance measure at redshift z= 0.275, of rs(zd)/DV(0.275) = 0.1390 ± 0.0037 (2.7 per cent accuracy), where rs(zd) is the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch, DV(z) ≡[(1 +z)2D2Acz/H(z)]1/3, DA(z) is the angular diameter distance and H(z) is the Hubble parameter. We find an almost independent constraint on the ratio of distances DV(0.35)/DV(0.2) = 1.736 ± 0.065, which is consistent at the 1.1$\sigma$ level with the best-fitting $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model obtained when combining our z= 0.275 distance constraint with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 5-year (WMAP5) data. The offset is similar to that found in previous analyses of the SDSS DR5 sample, but the discrepancy is now of lower significance, a change caused by a revised error analysis and a change in the methodology adopted, as well as the addition of more data. Using WMAP5 constraints on $\Omega$bh2 and $\Omega$c h2, and combining our BAO distance measurements with those from the Union supernova sample, places a tight constraint on $\Omega$m= 0.286 ± 0.018 and H0= 68.2 ± 2.2 km s−1 Mpc−1 that is robust to allowing $\Omega$k≠ 0 and w≠−1. This result is independent of the behaviour of dark energy at redshifts greater than those probed by the BAO and supernova measurements. Combining these data sets with the full WMAP5 likelihood constraints provides tight constraints on both $\Omega$k=−0.006 ± 0.008 and w=−0.97 ± 0.10 for a constant dark energy equation of state.},

abstract = {The angular power spectrum is a powerful statistic for analysing cosmological signals imprinted in the clustering of matter. However, current galaxy and quasar surveys cover limited portions of the sky, and are contaminated by systematics that can mimic cosmological signatures and jeopardize the interpretation of the measured power spectra. We provide a framework for obtaining unbiased estimates of the angular power spectra of large-scale structure surveys at the largest scales using quadratic estimators. The method is tested by analysing the 600 CMASS mock catalogues constructed for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We then consider the Richards et al. catalogue of photometric quasars from the sixth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which is known to include significant stellar contamination and systematic uncertainties. Focusing on the sample of ultraviolet-excess sources, we show that the excess clustering power present on the largest scales can be largely mitigated by making use of improved sky masks and projecting out the modes corresponding to the principal systematics. In particular, we find that the sample of objects with photometric redshift 1.3{\textless}z{\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}p{\textless}2.21.3 {\textless}{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}tilde{\{}z{\}}{\_}$\backslash${\{}{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}rm p{\}} {\textless}2.2 exhibits no evidence of contamination when using our most conservative mask and mode projection. This indicates that any residual systematics is well within the statistical uncertainties. We conclude that, using our approach, this sample can be used for cosmological studies.},

abstract = {We present a study of the effect of High Column Density (HCD) systems on the Lyman {\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}alpha forest correlation function on large scales. We study the effect both numerically, by inserting HCD systems on mock spectra for a specific model, and analytically, in the context of two-point correlations and linear theory. We show that the presence of HCDs substantially contributes to the noise of the correlation function measurement, and systematically alters the measured redshift-space correlation function of the Lyman {\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}alpha forest, increasing the value of the density bias factor and decreasing the redshift distortion parameter $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}beta\backslash{\_}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}alpha{\$} of the Lyman {\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}alpha forest. We provide simple formulae for corrections on these derived parameters, as a function of the mean effective optical depth and bias factor of the host halos of the HCDs, and discuss the conditions under which these expressions should be valid. In practice, precise corrections to the measured parameters of the Lyman {\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}alpha forest correlation for the HCD effects are more complex than the simple analytical approximations we present, owing to non-linear effects of the damped wings of the HCD systems and the presence of three-point terms. However, we conclude that an accurate correction for these HCD effects can be obtained numerically and calibrated with observations of the HCD-Lyman {\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}alpha cross-correlation. We also discuss an analogous formalism to treat and correct for the contaminating effect of metal lines overlapping the Lyman {\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}alpha forest spectra.},

abstract = {We investigate the effects of potential sources of systematic error on the angular and photometric redshift, zphot, distributions of a sample of redshift 0.4 {\textless}z {\textless}0.7 massive galaxies whose selection matches that of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) constant-mass sample. Utilizing over 112 778 BOSS spectra as a training sample, we produce a photometric redshift catalogue for the galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey eight data release imaging area that, after masking, covers nearly one quarter of the sky (9913 deg2). We investigate fluctuations in the number density of objects in this sample as a function of Galactic extinction, seeing, stellar density, sky background, airmass, photometric offset and North/South Galactic hemisphere. We find that the presence of stars of comparable magnitudes to our galaxies (which are not traditionally masked) effectively removes area. Failing to correct for such stars can produce systematic errors on the measured angular autocorrelation function, w($\theta$), that are larger than its statistical uncertainty. We describe how one can effectively mask for the presence of the stars, without removing any galaxies from the sample, and minimize the systematic error. Additionally, we apply two separate methods that can be used to correct for the systematic errors imparted by any parameter that can be turned into a map on the sky. We find that failing to properly account for varying sky background introduces a systematic error on w($\theta$). We measure w($\theta$), in four zphot slices of width 0.05 between 0.45 {\textless}zphot {\textless}0.65, and find that the measurements, after correcting for the systematic effects of stars and sky background, are generally consistent with a generic $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model, at scales up to 60°. At scales greater than 3° and zphot {\textgreater}0.5, the magnitude of the corrections we apply is greater than the statistical uncertainty in w($\theta$). The photometric redshift catalogue we produce will be made publicly available at http://portal.nersc.gov/project/boss/galaxy/photoz/.},

abstract = {We analyse the large-scale correlation function of the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) and detect a baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal at 105h-1Mpc. The 6dFGS BAO detection allows us to constrain the distance-redshift relation at zeff= 0.106. We achieve a distance measure of DV(zeff) = 457 ± 27Mpc and a measurement of the distance ratio, rs(zd)/DV(zeff) = 0.336 ± 0.015 (4.5 per cent precision), where rs(zd) is the sound horizon at the drag epoch zd. The low-effective redshift of 6dFGS makes it a competitive and independent alternative to Cepheids and low-z supernovae in constraining the Hubble constant. We find a Hubble constant of H0= 67 ± 3.2kms-1Mpc-1 (4.8 per cent precision) that depends only on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe-7 (WMAP-7) calibration of the sound horizon and on the galaxy clustering in 6dFGS. Compared to earlier BAO studies at higher redshift, our analysis is less dependent on other cosmological parameters. The sensitivity to H0 can be used to break the degeneracy between the dark energy equation of state parameter w and H0 in the cosmic microwave background data. We determine that w=-0.97 ± 0.13, using only WMAP-7 and BAO data from both 6dFGS and Percival et al. (2010). We also discuss predictions for the large-scale correlation function of two future wide-angle surveys: the Wide field ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) blind Hi survey (with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, ASKAP) and the proposed Transforming Astronomical Imaging surveys through Polychromatic Analysis of Nebulae (TAIPAN) all-southern-sky optical galaxy survey with the UK Schmidt Telescope. We find that both surveys are very likely to yield detections of the BAO peak, making WALLABY the first radio galaxy survey to do so. We also predict that TAIPAN has the potential to constrain the Hubble constant with 3 per cent precision. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {Thomson scattering of CMBR temperature anisotropies will cause the spectrum of the CMBR to differ from blackbody even when one resolves all anisotropies. A formalism for computing the anisotropic and inhomogeneous spectral distortions of intensity and polarization is derived in terms of Lorentz invariant central moments of the temperature distribution. The formalism is non-perturbative, requiring neither small anisotropies nor small metric or matter inhomogeneities; but it does assume cold electrons. The low order moments are not coupled to the higher order moments allowing one to truncate the equations without any loss of accuracy. This formalism is applied to a standard Lambda-CDM cosmology after reionization where the temperature anisotropies are dominated by the Doppler effect for the bulk motion of the gas with respect to the CMBR frame. The resultant spectral distortion is parameterized by u {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 3e-8, where in this case u is observationally degenerate with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) y parameter. In comparison the expected thermal SZ y-distortion from the hot IGM is expected to be {\textgreater}30 times larger. However at z {\textgreater}5 the effect described here would have been the dominant source of spectral distortions. The effect could be much larger in non-standard cosmologies.},

abstract = {Context: Galaxy metallicities have been measured to redshift z˜2 by gas-phase oxygen abundances of the interstellar medium using the R23 and N2 methods. Galaxy stellar metallicities provide crucial data for chemical evolution models but have not been assessed reliably much outside the local Universe. Aims: We determine the iron-abundance, stellar metallicity of star-forming galaxies at redshift z˜2, homogeneously-selected and observed as part of the Galaxy Mass Assembly ultra-deep Spectroscopic Survey (GMASS). Methods: We compute the equivalent width (EW) of a rest-frame mid-ultraviolet (mid-UV), photospheric absorption-line index, the 1978 {\AA} index, found to vary monotonically with stellar metallicity by Rix, Pettini and collaborators (R04), in model star-forming galaxy (SFG) spectra created using the theoretical massive star models of Pauldrach and coworkers, and the evolutionary population synthesis code Starburst99. The 1978 {\AA} index is sensitive to Fe III transitions and measures the iron-abundance, stellar metallicity. To accurately determine the 1978 {\AA} index EW, we normalise and combine 75 SFG spectra from the GMASS survey to produce a spectrum corresponding to a total integration time 1652.5 h (and a signal-to-noise ratio 100 for our 1.5 {\AA} binning) of FORS2 spectroscopic observations at the Very Large Telescope. Results: We measure a iron-abundance, stellar metallicity of log(Z/Z{\_}ȯ) = -0.574±0.159 for our spectrum representative of a galaxy of stellar mass 9.4×109 M{\_}ȯ assuming a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF). We find that the R04 model SFG spectrum for log (Z/Z{\_}ȯ) = -0.699 solar metallicity provides the best description of our GMASS coadded spectrum. For similar galaxy stellar mass, our stellar metallicity is 0.25 dex lower than the oxygen-abundance, gas-phase metallicity quantified by Erb and collaborators (E06) for UV-selected star-forming galaxies at z=2. Conclusions: We measure the iron-abundance, stellar metallicity of star-forming galaxies at redshift z˜2 by analysing the 1978 {\AA} index in a spectrum created by combining 75 galaxy spectra from the GMASS survey. We find that our measurement is 0.25 dex lower than the oxygen-abundance gas-phase metallicity at similar values of galaxy stellar mass. We conclude that we are witnessing the establishment of a light-element overabundance in galaxies as they are being formed at redshift z˜2. Our measurements are indeed reminiscent of the $\alpha$-element enhancement seen in the likely progenitors of these starburst galaxies at low-redshift, i.e. galactic bulges and early-type galaxies.},

The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4 +/- 0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well. Both descriptions provide potentially useful "recipes" for modeling the SFR in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

abstract = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) is designed to measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter over a larger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveys of large-scale structure. BOSS uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint as i = 19.9 over 10,000 deg2 to measure BAO to redshifts z {\textless}0.7. Observations of neutral hydrogen in the Ly$\alpha$ forest in more than 150,000 quasar spectra (g {\textless}22) will constrain BAO over the redshift range 2.15 {\textless}z {\textless}3.5. Early results from BOSS include the first detection of the large-scale three-dimensional clustering of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and a strong detection from the Data Release 9 data set of the BAO in the clustering of massive galaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. We project that BOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance dA to an accuracy of 1.0{\%} at redshifts z = 0.3 and z = 0.57 and measurements of H(z) to 1.8{\%} and 1.7{\%} at the same redshifts. Forecasts for Ly$\alpha$ forest constraints predict a measurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerate DA (z) and H –1(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9{\%} at z {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}} 2.5 when the survey is complete. Here, we provide an overview of the selection of spectroscopic targets, planning of observations, and analysis of data and data quality of BOSS.},

abstract = {DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based dark energy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the growth of structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxy and quasar redshift survey. To trace the underlying dark matter distribution, spectroscopic targets will be selected in four classes from imaging data. We will measure luminous red galaxies up to {\$}z=1.0{\$}. To probe the Universe out to even higher redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies up to {\$}z=1.7{\$}. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts ({\$} 2.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5{\$}), for the Ly-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} forest absorption features in their spectra, which will be used to trace the distribution of neutral hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficient observations of the faint targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct a magnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 million galaxies with a median {\$}z\backslashapprox 0.2{\$}. In total, more than 30 million galaxy and quasar redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determine the matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions.},

abstract = {The third generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) took data from 2008 to 2014 using the original SDSS wide-field imager, the original and an upgraded multi-object fiber-fed optical spectrograph, a new near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph, and a novel optical interferometer. All the data from SDSS-III are now made public. In particular, this paper describes Data Release 11 (DR11) including all data acquired through 2013 July, and Data Release 12 (DR12) adding data acquired through 2014 July (including all data included in previous data releases), marking the end of SDSS-III observing. Relative to our previous public release (DR10), DR12 adds one million new spectra of galaxies and quasars from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) over an additional 3000 sq. deg of sky, more than triples the number of H-band spectra of stars as part of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and includes repeated accurate radial velocity measurements of 5500 stars from the Multi-Object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS). The APOGEE outputs now include measured abundances of 15 different elements for each star. In total, SDSS-III added 2350 sq. deg of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of the Sloan Exploration of Galactic Understanding and Evolution 2 (SEGUE-2) survey; 2,497,484 BOSS spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216 stars over 9376 sq. deg; 618,080 APOGEE spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040 MARVELS spectra of 5,513 stars. Since its first light in 1998, SDSS has imaged over 1/3 of the Celestial sphere in five bands and obtained over five million astronomical spectra.},

The Cosmological Principle, a key assumption of the model is shown to be verified with increasing accuracy. The fact that the Universe seems to have expanded from and hot and dense past is supported by many independent probes (galaxy redshifts, Cosmic Microwave Background, Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis and reionization). The explosion of detailed observations in the last few decades has allowed for precise measurements of the cosmological parameters within Friedman-Lema{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}itre-Robertson-Walker cosmologies leading to the $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}Lambda{\$}CDM model: an apparently flat Universe, dominated by a cosmological constant, whose matter component is dominantly dark. We describe and discuss the various observational probes that led to this conclusion and conclude that the $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}Lambda{\$}CDM model, although leaving a number of open questions concerning the deep nature of the constituents of the Universe, provides the best theoretical framework to explain the observations.},

abstract = {We present a public code to generate a mock galaxy catalog in redshift space assuming a log-normal probability density function (PDF) of galaxy and matter density fields. We draw galaxies by Poisson-sampling the log-normal field, and calculate the velocity field from the linearised continuity equation of matter fields, assuming zero vorticity. This procedure yields a PDF of the pairwise velocity fields that is qualitatively similar to that of N-body simulations. We check fidelity of the catalog, showing that the measured two-point correlation function and power spectrum in real space agree with the input precisely. We find that a linear bias relation in the power spectrum does not guarantee a linear bias relation in the density contrasts, leading to a cross-correlation coefficient of matter and galaxies deviating from unity on small scales. We also find that linearising the Jacobian of the real-to-redshift space mapping provides a poor model for the two-point statistics in redshift space. That is, non-linear redshift-space distortion is dominated by non-linearity in the Jacobian. The power spectrum in redshift space shows a damping on small scales that is qualitatively similar to that of the well-known Fingers-of-God (FoG) effect due to random velocities, except that the log-normal mock does not include random velocities. This damping is a consequence of non-linearity in the Jacobian, and thus attributing the damping of the power spectrum solely to FoG, as commonly done in the literature, is misleading.},

Comparing ratios $\tau$OVI/$\tau$CIV($\tau$CIV) to those in realistic, synthetic spectra drawn from a hydrodynamical simulation and comparing to existing constraints on [Si/C] places strong constraints on the ultraviolet background (UVB) model using weak priors on allowed values of [Si/O]: for example, a quasar-only background yields [Si/O] 1.4, which is highly inconsistent with the [Si/O] 0 expected from nucleosynthetic yields and with observations of metal-poor stars. Assuming a fiducial quasar+galaxy UVB consistent with these constraints yields a primary result that [O/C]=0.66+/-0.06+/-0.2 this result pertains to gas with overdensity $\delta${\textgreater}2. Consistent results are obtained by similarly comparing $\tau$OVI/$\tau$HI($\tau$HI) and $\tau$OVI/$\tau$SiIV($\tau$SiIV) to simulation values, and also by directly ionization-correcting $\tau$OVI/$\tau$HI as a function of $\tau$HI into [O/H] as a function of density. Subdividing the sample reveals no evidence for evolution, but low- and high-$\tau$HI samples are inconsistent, suggesting either density dependence of [O/C] or-more likely-prevalence of collisionally ionized gas at high density.},

@article{guzzo_is_1997,
abstract = {I critically discuss in a pedagogical and phenomenological way a few crucial tests challenging the recent claims by Pietronero and
collaborators that there is no evidence from available galaxy catalogues that the Universe is actually homogeneous above a certain scale. In a series of papers, these authors assert that observations are consistent with a fractal distribution of objects extending to the limit of the present data. I show that while galaxies are indeed clustered in a scale-free (fractal) way on small and intermediate scales, this
behaviour does not continue indefinitely. Although the specific
wavelength at which the galaxy distribution apparently turns to
homogeneity is dangerously close to the size of the largest samples presently available, there are serious hints suggesting that this turnover is real and that its effects are detected in the behaviour of statistical estimators. The most recent claims of a continuing fractal hierarchy up to scales of several hundreds Megaparsecs seem to be ascribable to the use of incomplete samples or to an improper treatment of otherwise high-quality data sets. The fractal perspective,
nevertheless, represents a fruitful way to look at the clustering properties of galaxies, when properly coupled to the traditional gravitational instability scenario. In the last part of this paper I will try to clarify, at a very simple level, some of the confusion existing on the actual scaling properties of the galaxy distribution, and discuss how these can provide hints on the evolution of the
large-scale structure of the Universe.},

@article{yadav_fractal_2010,
abstract = {In the multifractal analysis of the large-scale matter distribution, the scale of the transition to homogeneity is defined as the scale above which the fractal dimension (Dq) of the underlying point distribution is equal to the ambient dimension (D) of the space in which points are distributed. With the finite sized weakly clustered distribution of tracers obtained from galaxy redshift surveys it is difficult to achieve this equality. Recently Bagla et al. have defined the scale of homogeneity to be the scale above which the deviation ($\Delta$Dq) of the fractal dimension from the ambient dimension becomes smaller than the statistical dispersion of $\Delta$Dq, i.e. . In this paper we use the relation between the fractal dimensions and the correlation function to compute for any given model in the limit of weak clustering amplitude. We compare $\Delta$Dq and for the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and discuss the implication of this comparison for the expected scale of homogeneity in the concordant model of cosmology. We estimate the upper limit to the scale of homogeneity to be close to 260 h−1 Mpc for the $\Lambda$CDM model. Actual estimates of the scale of homogeneity should be smaller than this as we have considered only the statistical contribution to and we have ignored cosmic variance and contributions due to survey geometry and the selection function. Errors arising due to these factors enhance and as $\Delta$Dq decreases with increasing scale, we expect to measure a smaller scale of homogeneity. We find that as long as non-linear corrections to the computation of $\Delta$Dq are insignificant, the scale of homogeneity does not change with epoch. The scale of homogeneity depends very weakly on the choice of tracer of the density field. Thus the suggested definition of the scale of homogeneity is fairly robust.},
